// no Home aggregate — `/dashboard/home` was RETIRED (§9-4) so each card reads its own reader and
// loads independently (a slow reader skeletons only its own card, never the page).
//
// The page performs NO money math. The only client-side derivations are the ones the canonical pages
// already do: a sign → tone classification, and a display SORT for Gainers/Losers (§9-6, Markets ND-1).
//
// LAYOUT: there is exactly ONE (§12ho1-6 — the Simple layout was removed). It is the grid the owner
// ratified in the browser (§12ho1-5), and its geometry lives in `home-grid.css`, which this page
// shares with the static reference specimen in /kitchen-sink — so what was ratified is what ships,
// and neither can drift from the other. No layout state, no branch, no switch anywhere.
//
