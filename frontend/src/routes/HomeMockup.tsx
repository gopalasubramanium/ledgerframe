// HOME MOCKUP — the ratification gate for the Home REBUILD (page-home §12ho1-4).
//
// STATIC BY CONSTRUCTION: no readers, no fetches, no state. Every figure below is hardcoded
// demo-shaped data whose only job is to show the GEOMETRY and DENSITY at a real breakpoint. It is
// mounted ONLY in /kitchen-sink — never at `/`. Wiring happens after the owner ratifies it, and
// then every figure comes from the canonical reader named in the ownership table (§2/D-038).
//
// Why a mockup at all: the first build shipped a correct widget LIST as a stacked column and failed
// the page's purpose. A widget list is not a layout — so the layout is ratified in a browser, at the
// hard breakpoint, BEFORE any wiring (§12ho1-4 gate).
//
// The demo figures are deliberately plausible, not real: the frame is labelled a mockup and the
// numbers are never served. Nothing here may become a code path that renders live data.
