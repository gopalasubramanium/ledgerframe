// THE ACCEPTANCE GATE, front end (page-legal §11-5, owner 2026-07-20).
//
// The owner ruled: the user must accept the licence terms + the product position, and unaccepted
// installs are LOCKED AT ENTRY. The enforcement is SERVER-SIDE and already shipped (§11-E1) — every
// /api/v1 read answers 451 until this install has accepted. THIS COMPONENT IS NOT THE LOCK. It is
// the only way a person can answer the question the lock is asking, and it is worth being precise
// about that: if this file were deleted the data would still be refused, which is the difference
// between a gate and a picture of one.
//
// IT SITS IN FRONT OF THE PIN, mirroring the server, where the acceptance check runs BEFORE the PIN
// check. Terms first, then unlock. The other order would leave an unaccepted PIN-less install —
// which is every fresh install — wide open.
//
// EVERY STRING A USER READS HERE IS SERVED (§9-3 / §9-8). Nothing in this file authors consent
// copy. The prompt is what the person is RECORDED as having agreed to, so it is held to the
// server-side accuracy bar rather than typed into a component where no guard can reach it.
// The wording is RATIFIED (owner, in chat, 2026-07-20 — page-legal §11, re-look item 2).
