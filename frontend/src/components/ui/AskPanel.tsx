/**
 * AskPanel — the D-067 Ask surface, COMPOSED from ratified primitives.
 *
 * DESIGN-SYSTEM §5.5 describes this panel's BEHAVIOUR — *"SSE streaming, fact-pack before answer,
 * validated-before-display, ephemeral, privacy-mode label always visible"* — while the Chrome
 * inventory beneath it lists no such component and `components/ui/` had none. Per CLAUDE.md a new
 * primitive needs a DESIGN-SYSTEM amendment, so the owner's §9(i) ruling was composition-first:
 * build from what is already ratified, and bring an amendment only for what composition cannot
 * express. This file is that composition — `Dialog`, `TextInput`, `Button`, `Skeleton`,
 * `EmptyState`, `StalenessChip` — and it needed no new primitive.
 *
 * WHAT THIS COMPONENT DOES NOT DO, because the milestone's whole point is that it must not:
 *   - it computes NO money and derives no figure (all money math is backend Decimal);
 *   - it composes NO disclaimer and NO fallback signal — both are SERVED and rendered verbatim.
 *     A client-built legal-adjacent string would be a second source of truth for a sentence
 *     Commitment 2 promises is FIXED, which is the §0-C defect this milestone exists to undo;
 *   - it PERSISTS NOTHING. State lives in this component and dies with it (D-016 / Commitment 6:
 *     "AI questions and answers are never persisted"). There is no localStorage here, and there
 *     must never be — a "recent questions" convenience would break a Commitment.

   * §12-2 (owner ruling, 2026-07-20) — the DISPLAY half of the disclaimer synthesis.
   *
   * Finding 4 recorded the disclaimer rendering twice: once ending the answer body, once as the
   * served footer element. Its options (a) and (b) each dropped one of the two copies and, with
   * it, one of two readers — (a) left the raw answer text without its own disclaimer for any
   * export/stream/copy consumer; (b) left model-narrated answers depending on the model to emit
   * it. The owner ruled BOTH halves instead of either option:
   *
   *   the answer TEXT always ends with the served constant (enforced in `grounding.py`, guarded
   *   by `test_ask_answer_projection.py`), and the PANEL projects the body without that trailing
   *   line, rendering the footer element ONCE.
   *
   * DE-DUPLICATION AT DISPLAY IS A PROJECTION, NOT A REDACTION — the same distinction Finding 1
   * settled for the fact pack. Nothing is withheld: the line is on screen, once, in the place the
   * client puts it, and it is still in the artifact the reader can copy out.
   *
   * It strips the SERVED constant, never a locally-known string. The panel composes no
   * legal-adjacent text and recognises none it was not given — matching on a hardcoded sentence
   * here would make this file a second source of truth for it, which is the §0-C defect.
