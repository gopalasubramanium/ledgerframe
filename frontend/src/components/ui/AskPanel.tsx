/**
 * AskPanel — the D-067 Ask surface, COMPOSED from ratified primitives.
 *
 * DESIGN-SYSTEM §5.5 describes this panel's BEHAVIOUR — *"SSE streaming, fact-pack before answer,
 * validated-before-display, ephemeral, privacy-mode label always visible"* — while the Chrome
 * inventory beneath it lists no such component and `components/ui/` had none. Per CLAUDE.md a new
 * primitive needs a DESIGN-SYSTEM amendment, so the owner's §9(i) ruling was composition-first:
 * build from what is already ratified, and bring an amendment only for what composition cannot
 * express. This file is that composition — `Dialog`, `TextInput`, `Button`, `Skeleton`,
 * `EmptyState`, `StalenessChip` — and it needed no new primitive.
 *
 * WHAT THIS COMPONENT DOES NOT DO, because the milestone's whole point is that it must not:
 *   - it computes NO money and derives no figure (all money math is backend Decimal);
 *   - it composes NO disclaimer and NO fallback signal — both are SERVED and rendered verbatim.
 *     A client-built legal-adjacent string would be a second source of truth for a sentence
 *     Commitment 2 promises is FIXED, which is the §0-C defect this milestone exists to undo;
 *   - it PERSISTS NOTHING. State lives in this component and dies with it (D-016 / Commitment 6:
 *     "AI questions and answers are never persisted"). There is no localStorage here, and there
 *     must never be — a "recent questions" convenience would break a Commitment.

              §17-1 (owner ruling, 2026-07-20) — IT RENDERS PRE-ANSWER ONLY, and this is a HANDOVER
              rather than a removal. D-067's "privacy-mode label always visible" is a promise to the
              READER that a locality statement is on screen at every moment; it is not a promise
              about this particular paragraph. Two of them at once — the posture line above, the
              provenance legend below — is what the owner found at the 3b walk, and two true
              statements of the same fact read as two claims the reader must reconcile.

              So: BEFORE an answer the posture line carries it, because a user must know where a
              question goes before they send it, and nothing else on screen can tell them.
              ONCE THE LEGEND RENDERS it carries it instead, and carries it BETTER — the posture
              line describes what is CONFIGURED, while the legend reports what ACTUALLY happened
              (§15-4, the lie that guard caught). Where they differ, the legend is the true one.

              Never both, and never neither. `provenance` is the condition rather than `phase`
              because the legend's presence is exactly what makes this line redundant — tying it to
              anything else would let a state exist with two statements or none. Both arms are
