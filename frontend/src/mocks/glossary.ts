    term: "Exposure",
    definition:
      "The base-currency amount a shock is applied to — your holdings grouped by what would move together (equities, crypto, property, foreign currencies). A share of gross assets; liabilities are not exposures.",

    term: "Progress (goal)",
    definition:

  },
  "term-coverage": {
    term: "Coverage",
    definition:
      "How much of a dimension your targets add up to. Under 100% is a legitimate policy, not an error — it means your policy deliberately does not speak for the rest.",

  "term-home": {
    term: "Home",
