// THE BIDIRECTIONAL RESOLUTION GUARD — frontend half (R-54 §9-D/§9-E).
//
// The backend served-half (`tests/integration/test_served_link_ids.py`) proves every SERVED ID is
// well-formed, of a known kind, and names a real route / Help entry — and, in this milestone,
// closes the loop from the file-parsing side: every served `canonical_page` is a route the frontend
// registry accepts (nav.ts built pages), every nav route is a route AppRoutes registers, and the
// served kinds equal `KNOWN_LINK_KINDS`. Those closures read `nav.ts` / `AppRoutes.tsx` as text, so
// they live in Python where file parsing is clean; jsdom/vitest has no node `fs` types here.
//
// This half proves the resolver's SEMANTICS, purely: every route it accepts round-trips, every
// served worked-example ID maps to the destination a user would follow, and anything it cannot map
// returns **null** — tier-1 declines rather than inventing a destination (§0-F dead-affordance 3).
//
// The `help:` topic direction is deliberately NOT re-checked here: an unknown `?topic=` is a silent
// no-op, topics validate against the SERVED catalogue on arrival (`Help.tsx:334`), and the backend
// guard binds served `help:` IDs to real entries. A static topic list here would be a SECOND source
// of truth for a served fact — the §0-C mistake.
