// THE FRONTEND-OWNED ID→ROUTE REGISTRY (R-54 §9-D). The backend issues semantic link IDs of the
// form `<kind>:<key>` (`app/services/figure_registry.py` canonical_page → `page:<route>`;
// `app/ai/tools.py` help hits → `help:<entry-id>`); this module is the ONLY place that turns one
// into a destination the Ask panel can navigate to. Same principle as `holdingsLink.ts`: a single
// builder so a served ID and its route can never silently diverge — two hand-built hrefs to one
// destination is how one rots (page-accounts §14ac-5).
//
// Owner ruling (R-54 §9-D): "Strict separation of concerns — backend issues semantic IDs, frontend
// maps them to routes — coupled with a bidirectional resolution guard eliminates silent dead-link
// failures." The guard lives in `askLinks.test.ts` (this half) and `tests/integration/
// test_served_link_ids.py` (the served half): every served ID is registered here, and every route
// this registry accepts resolves against the LIVE router (`AppRoutes.tsx`).
//
// Returns a react-router `to` value ("/net-worth", "/help?topic=term-xirr-twr"). Navigate through
// react-router (<Link to> / useNavigate), NEVER a manual `window.location.hash` write — the
// HashRouter renders `to` as `#<to>`, and a hash write mounts the destination before the router's
// location reflects the query (§14ac-2). A link that cannot resolve returns **null**: tier-1
// declines rather than inventing a destination — a link that resolves to nothing is a dead
// affordance with extra steps (§0-F dead-affordance 3).
