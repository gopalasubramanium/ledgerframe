    The suite shares ONE SQLite file (`LEDGERFRAME_DATA_DIR`, set once above). Some unit tests read
    the DB transitively — e.g. `openai_compatible.health()` runs the egress-posture check, which does
    `SELECT ... FROM settings WHERE key='privacy_mode'` — WITHOUT requesting a schema-creating fixture.
    They passed only because an earlier `session`/`app_client` test happened to leave the schema in the
    shared file; under `pytest-randomly` one of them can be scheduled first and hit `no such table:
    settings`. (A test that passes because an earlier test leaked schema is order-dependent even when
    nobody wrote it that way — the ordered suite's green for those tests was execution-order luck all
    along, the same species as the seed-lucky corroborations.)

    Fixed here by creating the schema ONCE, up front, on the shared file — via a throwaway SYNC engine
    so there is no event-loop/global-engine coupling. Migration/db tests are UNAFFECTED: they repoint
    `LEDGERFRAME_DATA_DIR` at their own `tmp_path` and run Alembic there, so the shared file's baseline
    is irrelevant to them. This is fixture plumbing only — it changes no product behaviour."""
