"""LEGAL CONTENT GUARDS (page-legal §9, ruled 2026-07-19).

The Legal page's copy is SERVED (§9-3) for exactly one reason: **server-side corpora are bound by
guards**. This module is the redemption of that rationale. If Legal's strings were a frontend
constant, none of what follows could exist, and the page whose entire job is to be true would be
the only page in the product nothing checks.

WHAT IS GUARDED HERE
--------------------
* **AC-L3** — the seven Product Commitments are VERBATIM. Asserted by string equality against
  ``docs/specs/PRODUCT-SPEC.md`` §3, parsed at test time. Not by eye, and not by a copy of the
  spec text living in the test (which would only prove the test agrees with itself).
* **AC-L5** — the §9-8 NEVER list, as four independent bites with named RED specimens.
* the served shape matches what the IA says Legal owns, so a section cannot quietly go missing.

The AC-L6 scoped-caveat registry lives in ``test_scoped_caveats.py``: it guards the TEN OTHER
surfaces, not this one, and a guard belongs with what it protects.
