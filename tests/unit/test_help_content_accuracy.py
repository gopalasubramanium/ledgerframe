"""HELP CONTENT ACCURACY GUARDS (page-help §9-7, ruled 2026-07-19).

The Help catalogue is prose ABOUT the product, served to users and cited by the AI. That makes it
the one surface where a sentence can be fluent, well-formed, reviewed — and false.

It had been false for a long time. The v1-era catalogue described pages this product does not have
("Snapshot", "Planning", "Investment policy"), a Simple/Expert toggle that was removed, a pencil
button that never shipped, four Settings tabs where six ship, and used wording two decisions had
already retired. None of it failed anything, because **nothing compared the copy to the product**.

A spec edit regenerates no contract, so a content rule with no test is a wish. These are the tests.

WHY THESE LIVE HERE AND NOT IN tests/integration/test_help.py: that module tests the KB's SHAPE and
its endpoint. These compare the KB against OTHER FILES in the repo (the nav model, the glossary's
deprecated-terms table) — the same repo-wide spec-vs-code posture as the parity guard next door.
