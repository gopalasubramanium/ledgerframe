"""The posture copy is RATIFIED copy, and it is pinned to its ratifying record.

The posture sentence is the one line on the Ask panel that states **what the device is doing**.
`§9 (f)` ruled the approach — *mode-and-consequence, unapologetic; a refusal renders as the
product's posture WORKING, never as an error* — and left the strings **PROPOSED until the 0a
specimen**. The owner ratified them at the 0a walk on **2026-07-20** (ai-surfaces.md §12-3).

**Why this needs a guard at all, when the strings are already in a route.** A posture sentence is
the product making a claim **about itself**, and it is the exact class of string that can go false
without anything failing: nothing computes it, no test asserts on its meaning, and a change that
reads fine — *"AI runs on this device only"* — can describe a state the device is not in. That
already happened once here: §12-3 records the drafted copy saying no-egress meant **no AI answering
at all**, when what shipped still answers, deterministically, from the user's own data. The
difference is invisible to `check:copy` and to every functional test.

This is the **AC-L3 spec↔code parity pattern** the fallback signal uses
(`test_d070_fallback_signal.py`): edit the record and the guard carries the change into the
product; edit the product alone and the guard goes red.

**Pinned against going blind, three ways** — because a parity guard is unusually easy to satisfy
vacuously:
  1. a **coverage** assertion, so a new posture branch cannot ship unratified copy by simply not
     being listed;
  2. a **length floor**, since any document contains the empty string;
  3. a **distinctness** assertion, since one string reused for every posture would satisfy parity
     while making the panel say the same thing in opposite states — which is the failure the
     posture copy exists to prevent.
