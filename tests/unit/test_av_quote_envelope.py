"""R-63 Phase 0 — the AlphaVantage entitlement-envelope parse.

The root cause R-63 opens on: with ``entitlement=delayed`` (sent on every AV call,
``external.py``), AlphaVantage returns ``GLOBAL_QUOTE`` data under a DECORATED
top-level key — ``"Global Quote - DATA DELAYED BY 15 MINUTES"`` — but the quote
parser read only ``data["Global Quote"]``, got ``{}``, and reported the price as
UNAVAILABLE on every symbol. The fix makes the quote parser tolerant of the
``"Global Quote*"`` key family (the ``_find_time_series`` precedent).

The fixtures are the CAPTURED REAL ENVELOPES (R-63 §9-0 rider — never hand-mocked):
- ``av_global_quote_entitled.json`` — probe #1, the decorated key with real fields.
- ``av_global_quote_empty.json``    — probe #5, AV's genuine-empty ``{"Global Quote": {}}``.

This is the canonical CAPABILITY-vs-PROPERTY case (CLAUDE.md / TEMPLATE): a live
provider returning HTTP 200 WITH DATA, which the code treated as "no data". A test
that only asks "does the call work?" stays green; only a test that asks "did we get
the PRICE?" turns red. This is that test — the one that would have caught this the
day ``entitlement=delayed`` (F-4) shipped.
