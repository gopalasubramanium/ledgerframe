"""Commitment 7's mechanism: the validation contract cannot be quietly weakened.

`PRODUCT-SPEC.md` §3 Commitment 7 — *"**The validation contract never weakens.**
Implementation may improve; the contract that every AI answer is checked against may
not be loosened."* D-071 gives the contract **protected status**, and
`SECURITY-BASELINE.md` §5 states it normatively in **seven numbered clauses**.

**Nothing mechanised "never weakens" (AI-surfaces §9(d-i)).** The 23 existing safety
tests assert the contract **holds** — that a recommendation is rejected, that an
ungrounded figure is rejected. Not one of them would notice a clause being **deleted**:
remove clause 5 from the spec and the code, and every remaining test stays green while
the product quietly checks less than it promises. "Holds" and "has not been loosened"
are different claims, and only the first had a test.

This file asserts the second, in two halves:

**Half 1 — the spec's shape is pinned.** The seven clauses are pinned by **count and
identity** to `SECURITY-BASELINE.md` §5. Deleting a clause, renumbering, or rewriting
one into something weaker fails here. This is the **AC-L3 spec↔code parity pattern**
already proven for the Commitments themselves (`tests/unit/test_legal_content.py`),
applied to the contract.

**Half 2 — each clause still bites.** Identity in a document is not enforcement, so each
clause is bound to a **red specimen**: model output that clause exists to reject. If a
clause survives in the spec while its implementation is loosened, half 1 stays green and
half 2 goes red. The two halves cover each other's blind spot.

Fail-first evidence is **kept, not merely performed** (the page-legal §11-F idiom): the
last test in this file feeds the pin a deliberately-weakened spec and asserts it
*rejects* it, so the guard is proven to bite rather than assumed to.
