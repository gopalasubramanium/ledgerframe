"""AC-L6 — THE SCOPED-CAVEAT REGISTRY (page-legal §9-2, owner 2026-07-19; D-106).

THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS TO PREVENT is not a bug. It is a REVIEWER BEING DILIGENT.

CLAUDE.md's hard rule reads: *"Every piece of information has ONE canonical page. Other pages may
summarize it with a link, never duplicate it."* The Legal page is now the canonical home for the
product-level position. A future reviewer applying that rule honestly, in good faith, at speed,
will see twenty-five served `disclaimer` strings scattered across the services and read them as
twenty-five copies of the thing Legal now owns. Deleting them would look like tidying. It would
pass review. It would shrink the diff.

**It would also be the single largest honesty regression the product could suffer**, and §9-2
rules it out in advance:

* a **scoped caveat** is served by the reader that owns a figure, sits at the point of use, and is
  **part of the figure** — it says what THAT number is and is not, where you read it;
* the **product-level position** is stated once, on Legal;
* one-canonical-home governs the second and **not** the first;
* therefore **removing a scoped caveat is an HONESTY REGRESSION, not a de-duplication.**

A rule recorded in a plan file cannot stop that reviewer. A RED test can.

WHY THIS IS DISCOVERED, NOT LISTED
----------------------------------
The page-legal §0-D survey enumerated **ten** surfaces by hand. Discovery finds **twenty-five**.
The survey was not careless — it read the ten that serve a page-facing reader, and missed the
grounding pack, the analytics readers, statements, review, scenarios, runway, liquidity, policy and
tags. That gap is the argument: **a hand-written registry protects what its author happened to
remember, and silently abandons the rest.** So the floor below is generated from the tree, and the
guard asserts the count never falls — which protects the caveats nobody has thought about yet.

Additions are free and unguarded: this is a FLOOR, not a fixed set. Nothing here discourages a new
caveat, and everything here notices a deleted one.
