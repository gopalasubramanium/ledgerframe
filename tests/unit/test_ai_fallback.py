"""Grounded answer stream is resilient: it never leaves an empty answer box.

Covers the failures that made remote Ollama "produce no output": a model that
errors, and a reasoning model that emits only <think>…</think>. In both cases the
stream must still deliver the deterministic data fallback (and surface the error).

    ⚠ This used to assign ``grounding.get_ai_provider`` directly and restore only
    ``app.providers.ai.get_ai_provider`` — so the fake provider **leaked into every
    test that ran after this file in the same process**. It was invisible when this
    file ran alone and turned
    ``test_ai_grounding.py::test_answer_includes_grounding_facts_with_timestamps``
    red whenever it ran after: that test asks for the deterministic fallback and got
    this file's ``"Real answer."`` instead. An order-dependent failure that blames an
    innocent file is the worst kind to debug, so the patch is now scoped by
    ``monkeypatch``, which restores at teardown unconditionally.

    Patching ``grounding``'s binding is the correct and sufficient target:
    ``grounding.py`` does ``from app.providers.ai import get_ai_provider``, so it
    holds its own reference and never re-reads the source module.
