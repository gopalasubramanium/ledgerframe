"""R-58 — the `settings.key` check-then-insert race at the four filed sites.

The F10 delta fixed this race at four sites INSIDE `get_history_cached`; the ruling required a
read-only sweep of `app/` for the same shape rather than stopping at the reported defect. Four more
sites carry it, each shaped ``SELECT Setting -> if absent, session.add(Setting(...)) -> flush()`` on
`settings.key`: two concurrent callers both read absent, both insert, and the loser dies on
``UNIQUE constraint failed: settings.key`` — a 500 on a request that did nothing wrong.

The fix promotes F10's `_claim_marker` savepoint primitive to a shared home
(`app/db/claim.py::claim_setting`): the insert goes inside a SAVEPOINT so the loser's
``IntegrityError`` rolls back to the savepoint instead of poisoning the caller's transaction, and the
caller learns whether it won. The four filed sites keep their SELECT-first update-if-present branch
(the genuine already-present case is not a race) and delegate only the absent-INSERT to the primitive.

Two layers of proof, per F10's hardest-won lessons:
  * a DETERMINISTIC collision test on the primitive — the raw shape RAISES (documented, fix-independent),
    the primitive ABSORBS and leaves the session usable;
  * a CONCURRENT test per site driving real requests against the app — a race only reasoned about is a
    race "fixed" by a change nobody watched work. Each asserts it REACHED the guarded insert (the F10
    blindness pin: a green test that never arrived is indistinguishable from one that found nothing).
