"""FIGURES REACH THE READER ONLY THROUGH THE PROJECTION — R-54 §9-C, Phase 0-4.

*Owner:* "Enforcing strict data projection pipelines — where figures only flow through verified
fact-packs — prevents raw data leaks and UI formatting inconsistencies."

Three properties, and the third is the one with teeth:

1.  **The census is DECLARED** (ruling item 2). Every registry row carries ``pack_reachable``, and
    it must match what the pack can actually produce. A map that drifts from the territory is worse
    than no map — it is a map you trust.
2.  **Extensions are narrow-by-demand** (item 1). The pack gained exactly the rows tier-1 can
    resolve to; it did not gain everything the engine computes.
3.  **THE BOUNDARY IS GUARDED** (item 3). Tier-1 must never name a figure whose row is not
    pack-reachable — such a question takes the ratified honest-miss shape. *The registry is a map of
    where figures live, never a promise that the AI serves them all.*

Plus §9-C's two fail-firsts: a ``to_display`` float must not reach the pack, and no fact value may
bypass the single rendering path.
