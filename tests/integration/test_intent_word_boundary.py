"""SUBSTRING MATCHING IS NOT INTENT MATCHING — the R-54 §9-A word-boundary specimens.

R-54 §0-A found `gather_facts` routed on bare SUBSTRING membership (`app/ai/tools.py:561-576`,
`has(*ws)` → `any(w in q for w in ws)`), so a fact source fired on a fragment inside an unrelated
word:

    "los"  ⊂ c-LOS-ed, LOS-t, LOS-e        → movers facts on a question about closed-end funds
    "own"  ⊂ d-OWN-load, d-OWN-grade, kn-OWN → holdings facts on "how do I download my data"
    "down" ⊂ DOWN-load, DOWN-grade          → movers facts, same questions
    "mov"  ⊂ re-MOV-e                       → movers facts on "remove a holding"
    "spread" ⊂ SPREAD-sheet                 → allocation facts on an export question

**Why this is a correctness defect and not untidiness.** Tier-1's entire claim is DETERMINISM, and
these matches are deterministic — they are reliably WRONG, which is worse than noisy. A user asking
a pure help question ("how do I download my data") was handed their gainers and detractors as the
grounded basis of the answer, and the model was told those facts were relevant. The pack is capped
at 20 (`_dedupe`, `tools.py:523`), so junk facts do not merely sit there: **they evict real ones.**

ASSERTED AT THE SERVED PACK, NOT AT THE HELPER — the F5/Finding-5 lesson (`ai-surfaces.md` §15-1,
`test_ai_fact_pack_canonical.py`): the defect is a routing bypass, so a test of the matcher in
isolation can pass while the pack served to the panel still carries the junk. These drive
`POST /ai/chat` and read the `facts` event the panel actually renders.

RULED at the R-54 §9 one-pass (chat, 2026-07-20): `classify_intent`'s closed enum is the SINGLE
intent authority, `gather_facts`' flags become derivations of it in ONE table, and matching is
WORD-BOUNDARY. Owner: "A single source of truth for intent resolution prevents contradictory
states; deterministic matching is superior to probabilistic guessing for core navigation."

FAIL-FIRST: every assertion here was seen RED on the pre-fix build (r54 Phase 0-1).
