"""TIER-1 ACTION/NAV SCOPE — R-54 W-5 (owner ruling 2026-07-22, 0a-ii loop-1).

A tier-1 (b)/(c) answer — "how do I add a holding", "how do I change the theme" — is SCOPED to
the top help hit + its labeled link, and NOTHING else. No portfolio headline figures, no second
help fact. The pointer IS the answer (W-4). Tier-2 grounding keeps the full pack (this is
MODE-scoped, never global), so a model still narrates from everything.

RULING: "Tier-1 (b)/(c) scope = the top help hit + its labeled link, nothing else. Guard: an
action/nav tier-1 answer carrying portfolio headline facts turns RED."

Driven at the SERVED pack (`POST /ai/chat`), which under the suite's default posture
(`LEDGERFRAME_AI_ENABLED=false` → tier 1) is exactly the tier the scope governs.

FAIL-FIRST: on the pre-W-5 build these answers carried `portfolio_facts` (Net worth, Unrealised
P/L, Today's change, Total return) PREPENDED plus a second/third help fact — seen RED here.
