"""R-63 Phase 1 — the execution net (§9-1): the priority chain is REAL at fetch time.

Pin-head-keep-net: a route head (override / matrix cell / active lane) is tried first, but a
FAILED head falls through to the next capable+keyed market lane — yahoo, the keyless free net.

The capability-vs-property lesson (CLAUDE.md): it is not enough that *a price appeared* — the
test must prove the NET EXECUTED, i.e. that yahoo's fetch was actually invoked and its value is
what got stored (head=X, priced-by=Y). A test that only checked ``price is not None`` could pass
on a stale cache read; this one observes the fallback lane's call.
