"""THE PROVENANCE LEGEND MATCHES THE GENERATION PATH — §14-4, owner ruling 2026-07-20.

The walk's centrepiece. The panel already showed the reader WHAT AN ANSWER IS BUILT FROM; it never
showed WHO WROTE THE SENTENCE. Those are different questions, and the second is the one a reader
needs in order to weigh the first — a figure they can check against the pack themselves and a
figure a model phrased for them warrant different scrutiny even when they are the same figure.

    Built-in intelligence only — no model was used.
    Facts: built-in · Narration: on-device model — nothing left this device.
    Facts: built-in · Narration: external model.

⚠ THE ONE THING THESE TESTS EXIST TO CATCH: **a legend that reports the CONFIGURATION rather than
what HAPPENED.** Reading the legend off `resolve_posture()` is the natural implementation and is a
LIE in exactly the states the fallback exists to handle — provider down, rate limited, empty reply,
validation rejected. In every one of those a model is configured, no model wrote a word of what is
on screen, and a configuration-derived legend would credit it anyway. **A built-in-only legend on a
narrated answer is RED; a narration legend on a fallback is RED.** Both directions are driven here
against a REAL stream, not a unit call.

The validation-rejected branch is the sharpest case and gets its own test: the model DID write
something, and the reader is not seeing a word of it. An answer the validator threw away is not
narration.
