"""SERVED SEMANTIC LINK IDs — R-54 §9-D, Phase 0-5.

*Owner:* "Strict separation of concerns — backend issues semantic IDs, frontend maps them to
routes — coupled with a bidirectional resolution guard eliminates silent dead-link failures."

This file is the **served half**. The backend issues `<kind>:<key>` IDs; the frontend's ID→route
registry lands in Phase 1. What is guarded here:

* every served ID is **well-formed** and of a **known kind**;
* every `help:` ID names an entry the **served Help catalogue actually contains**;
* every `page:` ID names a route **`AppRoutes.tsx` actually registers** — checked against the real
  router, so a dead destination reds here rather than surviving to Phase 1;
* a fact with no canonical destination carries **no link at all** — `None` is the honest answer.

CAPABILITY PROBES (owner ruling 2026-07-21, item 2a). Property guards alone are what let F-6 ship:
they proved the thing that changed and never asked whether the capability still worked. So the
probes below drive **real questions end-to-end at the served surface** and assert the link a user
would actually follow.

THE REDUNDANT-ROUTE AUDIT (item 2b) is written into each probe: every assertion states what OTHER
route could satisfy it, and distinguishes them where two exist. *An assertion reachable two ways
cannot tell you which one broke.*
