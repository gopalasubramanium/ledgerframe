"""R-54 F-10 — the process-global reset registry + the autouse reset action.

ONE declaration, consumed by BOTH:
  * the autouse `_reset_process_globals` fixture (conftest) — resets these BETWEEN tests, so a
    `session`-only or unit test never inherits a global another test left dirty; and
  * the census guard (`tests/unit/test_module_state_census.py`) — AST-sweeps `app/` for
    module-level mutable state and asserts every RUNTIME-MUTATED global is declared here.

A new module-level mutable global that is written at runtime and NOT registered here turns the
census guard RED — the test-isolation debt class F-10 fixed can never silently regrow (ruled shape
2e). The reset list is therefore an ENUMERATION derived from the sweep, not from memory.

Background (F-10, 2026-07-23): the randomized verdict, once restored, exposed two vector classes —
Class B (fx/ecb caches reset only in `app_client` leaked to `session`-only cost-FX tests) and
Class A (unit tests reading `settings.privacy_mode` via the shared DB before any schema fixture
ran). Class A is the schema baseline (conftest); Class B is this registry.
