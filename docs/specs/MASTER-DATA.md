# MASTER-DATA.md — LedgerFrame v2 Controlled Vocabularies & Masters

**Normative.** This file is the single register of every controlled vocabulary
and reference master in v2. CLAUDE.md hard rule: every categorical field
references this file; no free-text enums. D-005 completeness rule: **every
vocabulary must appear here with its complete seed value list — no vocabulary is
confirmed without its values.** The DEF backfill extracted the pending
vocabularies verbatim from the legacy v1 source (read-only reference); the two
that have no definition in code — `asset_subclass` (§2 †) and the sector seed
(§6 †) — are **authored proposals** (no extraction was possible), every value
tagged **PROPOSED** and ratified at review. Nothing is guessed. [§9](#9-blocked-extractions)
is now empty.

---

## 1. Architecture (D-005, "hybrid")

Two mechanisms, no third:

**A. Fixed vocabularies** — code-defined enums.
- Defined once in backend code.
- Served to the frontend via a **single `/refdata` endpoint**. There is no
  second copy anywhere.
- Enforced at the database with **CHECK constraints** (today these fields are
  unconstrained `String` columns — see 02-DATA-MODEL §4; v2 adds the CHECK).
- Not user-editable.

**B. User-extensible masters** — database reference tables.
- Rows live in DB tables; referencing columns are **FK-enforced**.
- Users add/rename/merge rows through an admin screen (§7).

**Frontend carries zero vocabulary copies.** `refdata.ts`, `policyTemplates.ts`,
and every inline list (`CURRENCIES`, `COUNTRIES`, `ASSET_CLASSES`,
`TXN_ASSET_CLASSES`, …) are retired (D-005, D-049). The frontend obtains fixed
vocabularies from `/refdata` and extensible masters from their own endpoints.
The 6-value `TXN_ASSET_CLASSES` subset is deleted; forms use the full 13-value
`AssetClass` from `/refdata` (D-049).

Governing rule for confirmation: a vocabulary is "confirmed" only when its
complete value list is written here. Fixed vocabularies whose values are fully
recorded in DECISIONS.md D-010 or the schema audit are confirmed below (§2);
those whose values live only in un-extracted service code are **not confirmed**
(§9).

---

## 2. Fixed vocabularies (served via `/refdata`, DB CHECK)

Each is code-defined and enumerated in full. "Column(s)" names the storage from
02-DATA-MODEL. Source column: `D-010` = enumerated verbatim in DECISIONS.md
D-010; `02` = from the schema audit.

| Vocabulary | Column(s) | Count | Complete seed values | Source |
|------------|-----------|-------|----------------------|--------|
| **TxnType** | `transactions.type` | 11 | `buy, sell, dividend, interest, deposit, withdrawal, fee, split, bonus, merger, transfer` | D-010 |
| **AssetClass** | `instruments.asset_class`, `holdings.asset_class` | 13 | `equity, etf, mutual_fund, bond, cash, fixed_deposit, commodity, crypto, property, private, retirement, liability, other` | D-010 |
| **liquidity_profile** | `instruments.liquidity_profile` | 5 | `listed, redeemable, locked, illiquid, manual` | D-010 |
| **Entity.kind** | `entities.kind` | 5 | `self, spouse, trust, company, other` | D-010 |
| **Goal.basis** | `goals.basis` | 3 | `net_worth, liquid, none` | D-010 |
| **Obligation.recurrence** | `obligations.recurrence` | 4 | `once, monthly, quarterly, annual` | D-010 |
| **Obligation.kind** | `obligations.kind` | 2 | `expense, income` | D-010 |
| **Contribution.frequency** | `contribution.frequency` | 4 | `monthly, quarterly, annual, once` | D-010 |
| **Contribution.kind** | `contribution.kind` | 3 | `invest, withdraw, prepay` | D-010 |
| **EstateProfile.will_status** | `estate_profile.will_status` | 4 | `none, draft, executed, needs_update` | D-010 |
| **EstateDocument.status** | `estate_document.status` | 3 | `present, missing, outdated` | D-010 |
| **ValuationMethod** | `instruments.valuation_method`, provenance | 9 | `market_quote, official_nav, broker_quote, manual_valuation, statement_import, calculated_accrual, estimated_value, fx_reference, unavailable` | D-010 |
| **EntitlementStatus** | `quotes.entitlement`, provenance | 5 | `real-time, delayed, end-of-day, cached, unavailable` | D-010 |
| **PolicyTarget.dimension** | `policy_targets.dimension` | 3 | `asset_class, currency, region` | 02 §2.8 |
| **InstrumentIdentifier.id_type** | `instrument_identifiers.id_type` | 8 | `isin, cusip, figi, sedol, amfi_code, kite_token, coingecko_id, provider_symbol` | 02 §2.2 |
| **cost_basis_method** | `accounts.cost_basis_method` | 2 (v2) | `fifo, average` (v2 lanes; `spec` is ROADMAP R-6, D-018 — not a v2 value) | D-018 |
| **Account.kind** | `accounts.kind` | 7 | `brokerage, bank, retirement, wallet, property, manual, other` | DEF-3 |
| **InsurancePolicy.policy_type** | `insurance_policy.policy_type` | 10 | `term_life, whole_life, health, critical_illness, disability, personal_accident, property, motor, travel, other` | DEF-4 |
| **InsurancePolicy.premium_frequency** | `insurance_policy.premium_frequency` | 4 | `monthly, quarterly, annual, single` | DEF-4 |
| **EstateDocument.category** | `estate_document.category` | 9 | `will, insurance, property, loan, identity, bank, tax, medical, other` | DEF-5 |
| **EstateContact roles** | `estate_contact.roles` (JSON list) | 5 | `nominee, beneficiary, executor, emergency, guardian` | DEF-5 |
| **Instrument.asset_subclass** | `instruments.asset_subclass` | 6 (PROPOSED) | `crypto, derivative, equity, etf, mutual_fund, reit` (authored — per-value table below) | DEF-2 † |

**Notes on specific vocabularies:**
- `TxnType` — the frontend gains `merger` (previously omitted from the 10-value
  client list); the canonical set is the 11 backend values (D-010).
- `ValuationMethod` — `calculated_accrual` and `statement_import` remain in the
  vocabulary but **no v2 lane emits them** (D-073). The values are retained; the
  routing chains do not produce them.
- `EntitlementStatus` — LedgerFrame never claims `real-time` for its own data;
  the value exists to record a source's *claim* (GLOSSARY, D-027).
- `id_type` — the high-confidence subset (globally unique per instrument) is
  `{isin, cusip, figi, sedol, amfi_code, kite_token, coingecko_id}`;
  `provider_symbol` is the non-high-confidence remainder (02 §2.2).
- **`other` across vocabularies (D-087)** — `other` is **retained** in every
  fixed vocabulary that carries it (`AssetClass`, `Account.kind`,
  `InsurancePolicy.policy_type`, `EstateDocument.category`, `Entity.kind`, …) as
  the **honest escape valve**: a user is never forced into a wrong specific
  value. Over-use of `other` on holdings is surfaced by the Review signal
  `_OTHER_CLASS_OVERUSE_PCT = 10` (%) (PRODUCT-SPEC §5), prompting proper
  reclassification — the value stays, the nudge is separate.

**Notes on the backfilled vocabularies (DEF-3/4/5):**
- `Account.kind` — extracted from `ACCOUNT_KINDS` verbatim (DEF-3 resolved).
- `InsurancePolicy.premium_frequency` — the value set is `..., single` (a
  paid-once policy), **not** `once`; distinct from `Contribution.frequency`
  (`..., once`). Do not conflate them.
- `EstateContact roles` — this is the `CONTACT_ROLES` vocabulary into which the
  former free-text `relationship` field is **folded** (D-010); the separate
  `relationship` field is dropped. Stored as a JSON list on `estate_contact.roles`.
- `estate.py` also confirms `WILL_STATUSES` and `DOC_STATUSES` match the D-010
  values already in the table above (bonus confirmation from the same source).

### `Instrument.asset_subclass` — authored fixed vocabulary (DEF-2 †)

D-009 specifies `asset_subclass` as a **fixed vocabulary**, but there is **no
enum in code** — it is a free `String(40)` populated ad hoc. This vocabulary is
therefore **authored, not extracted** (†): confirmed values come from code, the
rest are **PROPOSED** and ratified at review. Each value states which consumer
reads it.

| Value | Status | Consumer (reads it) | Source / justification |
|-------|--------|---------------------|------------------------|
| `derivative` | **confirmed** | **PriceSourceRouter** — `lane_for` routes `sub == "derivative"` → the `derivative` lane (`kite → statement → manual`). The **only** subclass value read for behaviour. | assigned `kite.py:94`, `market.py:417/433`; read `router.py:131`, lane `router.py:123` |
| `crypto` | **confirmed** | display-only (routing keys on `asset_class == crypto`, not the subclass) | assigned `coingecko.py:89` |
| `equity` | **confirmed** | display-only | assigned `kite.py:97` |
| `mutual_fund` | **confirmed** | display-only | assigned `amfi.py:75` |
| `etf` | **PROPOSED** | display-only | named by D-009; distinguishes ETFs from direct equity in taxonomy/reporting. Not assigned anywhere in code. |
| `reit` | **PROPOSED** | display-only | named by D-009; distinguishes REITs (property-like listed equity) for display. Not assigned anywhere in code. |

**Deliberately excluded:** `bond`, `deposit`/`fixed_deposit`, `retirement`.
Although D-073's manual lanes exist for these, `lane_for` selects them by
**`asset_class`** (`bond` / `fixed_deposit` / `retirement`), **not** by
`asset_subclass` (`router.py:128-145`) — no subclass value is read for them, so
adding one would be redundant and misleading. The historical migration
`a3d21f7e5b10:70` backfilled `asset_subclass = asset_class`; a v2 migration
should normalise any such rows to the vocabulary above (unmapped → null).

**Classification guidance (D-085).** `asset_class` describes economic
**exposure**; `asset_subclass` describes the **wrapper**. The two are set
independently: a listed REIT is `asset_class = property` with
`asset_subclass = reit` (property exposure, listed-equity wrapper); an equity
ETF is `asset_class = equity` with `asset_subclass = etf`; a bond fund's class
stays `bond` regardless of wrapper. This resolves the `etf`/`reit` review
challenge (REVIEW-GUIDE A1): both PROPOSED values are kept, and this rule governs
how they are assigned.

---

## 3. Currency master (D-006)

A reference master, not a plain enum, because it carries a flag.

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `code` | ISO-4217 alpha-3 (e.g. SGD, USD). PK. |
| `is_base_eligible` | Boolean. `true` = usable as **base/reporting** currency; the wider set (`false` too) is valid only as a **transaction** currency. |

**FX-translatability rule (governing, D-006):** *a currency may exist in the
master only if the FX service can translate it.* Any candidate that the FX
service cannot translate is not admitted.

**Base-currency picker** draws from `is_base_eligible = true` only
(Settings → base currency). Transaction/holding currency fields draw from the
full master.

**Seed (DEF-1, extracted).** The seed is the **union** of three divergent legacy
lists, deduplicated (`HKD` appears twice in the PortfolioEditor list):

| Group | Codes | `is_base_eligible` | Source |
|-------|-------|--------------------|--------|
| Base-eligible (`config.SUPPORTED_CURRENCIES`, 9) | `SGD, USD, INR, EUR, GBP, JPY, AUD, CNY, HKD` | **true** | `config.py:18` |
| + adds from `refdata.ts CURRENCIES` (14) | `CAD, CHF, AED, MYR, THB` | false | `refdata.ts:8` |
| + adds from PortfolioEditor inline (21 unique) | `KRW, TWD, SEK, NOK, DKK, ZAR, BRL, NZD` | false | `PortfolioEditor.tsx:22` |

**Full seed = 22 unique codes**, `is_base_eligible = true` for exactly the 9
`SUPPORTED_CURRENCIES`, `false` for the other 13.

**FX-translatability validation is operational, not a static list.** The FX
service holds no hard-coded translatable set: `ecb_fx._RATES` is loaded at
runtime from the ECB daily reference feed (`ecb_fx.py:24,71-73`) and `fx.py`
triangulates cross rates through USD with ECB as fallback (`fx.py:51`). So D-006's
rule is enforced **at admission time against the live FX service**, not by a code
constant. The 9 base-eligible codes are FX-supported by definition
(`config.SUPPORTED_CURRENCIES`); the 13 wider codes must be confirmed
translatable when the currency master is seeded (any that the FX service cannot
translate are dropped per D-006, not carried).

**ROADMAP (R-2, D-006):** user-requestable transaction currencies, FX-validated.

---

## 4. Country & region model (D-007)

**`instruments.listing_country` (ISO-3166 alpha-2) is the single authoritative
country field.** Dropped: `instruments.country` (free text) and
`instruments.domicile_country`.

- **Reference table:** the ISO-3166-1 alpha-2 standard seeds the country picker
  (the seed *is* the published ISO-3166 code list — a standard, not a decision
  to author).
- **Region is derived, never stored as a separate vocabulary** (D-007). The
  bucket set was **expanded from four to six** at review (D-083). The six values
  below are the complete `region` vocabulary (used as a policy-dimension bucket
  set, D-055/02 §2.8):

  | Region | `listing_country` members |
  |--------|---------------------------|
  | **India** | `IN` |
  | **Singapore** | `SG` |
  | **US** | `US` |
  | **Europe** | `GB, IE, FR, DE, NL, BE, LU, CH, AT, ES, PT, IT, GR, SE, NO, DK, FI, IS, PL, CZ, SK, HU, RO, BG, HR, SI, EE, LV, LT, CY, MT` |
  | **APAC** | `JP, CN, HK, MO, TW, KR, AU, NZ, MY, TH, ID, PH, VN` (Asia-Pacific excluding `IN`/`SG`) |
  | **Other** | **catch-all** — any `listing_country` not listed above (e.g. `CA, MX, BR, AR, CL, AE, SA, IL, TR, ZA, RU, …`). |

  The derivation is: match `IN`/`SG`/`US` first; then the Europe and APAC
  membership lists; anything unmatched falls to **Other**. Membership is
  authored (D-083) and may be extended by amending this table (a code +
  migration change, not a user action — region is derived, not stored).

**ROADMAP (R-3, D-007):** re-introduce a domicile field for fund-tax display.

---

## 5. Timezone (D-013)

`Settings` timezone becomes an **IANA timezone** select, replacing free-text
entry. The seed is the **IANA Time Zone Database** (`tz` database) name list — a
maintained standard, served to the picker; not a value list authored here.

---

## 6. User-extensible masters (DB reference tables, FK-enforced)

| Master | Referencing columns (FK) | Seed | Uniqueness |
|--------|--------------------------|------|-----------|
| **Institution** (D-008) | `accounts.institution`, `insurance_policy.insurer` | none (starts empty; user-populated) | by name; merge dedupes variants ("DBS" vs "DBS Bank") |
| **Sector** (D-009) | `instruments.sector` | 11 GICS sectors (authored, PROPOSED — see below) | by name |
| **Tag** (D-011) | `holding_tag.tags` (JSON list, keyed by `account_id` + `holding_key`) | none | **case-insensitive**, cap **16 tags/holding** |

**Institution (D-008).** One master, FK'd from both `accounts.institution` and
`insurance_policy.insurer`. Estate `estate_document.related_to` stays **free
text by design** (architectural invariant — the estate register deliberately
does not FK into other tables; do not "normalise" it).

**Sector (D-009) — authored seed (DEF-6 †).** User-extensible, seeded GICS-like.
There is **no sector master or GICS list in code** (only the `_SECTOR_MAP`
ticker→sector fallback, `portfolio.py:30-51`), so the seed is **authored, not
extracted** (†) and ratified at review. Proposed seed = the **11 standard GICS
sectors** (all **PROPOSED**); users may add more (extensible):

1. Energy · 2. Materials · 3. Industrials · 4. Consumer Discretionary ·
5. Consumer Staples · 6. Health Care · 7. Financials ·
8. Information Technology · 9. Communication Services · 10. Utilities ·
11. Real Estate.

**Migration mapping — code-observed `_SECTOR_MAP` (12) → seed** (no silent
merges; unmapped values are flagged, not forced):

| `_SECTOR_MAP` value | → GICS seed sector | Note |
|---------------------|--------------------|------|
| `Technology` | **Information Technology** | clean rename to the GICS canonical label |
| `Communication Services` | Communication Services | exact |
| `Consumer Discretionary` | Consumer Discretionary | exact |
| `Consumer Staples` | Consumer Staples | exact |
| `Financials` | Financials | exact |
| `Energy` | Energy | exact |
| `Health Care` | Health Care | exact |
| `Industrials` | Industrials | exact |
| `Utilities` | Utilities | exact |
| `Crypto` | **(no map)** | not a GICS sector — it is an asset class. **Migration:** set `sector = null`; allocation already handled by `asset_class`. Do **not** merge into a sector. |
| `Index / ETF` | **(no map)** | a fund wrapper, not a sector. **Migration:** `sector = null` (resolve from constituents if ever needed). Do **not** merge. |
| `Commodities` | **(no map)** | a commodity asset, not a company sector (≠ GICS *Materials*). **Migration:** `sector = null`; handled by `asset_class`. Do **not** merge into Materials. |

GICS **Materials** and **Real Estate** are seeded even though no `_SECTOR_MAP`
ticker used them (they simply start empty).

**Null-sector display (D-082).** The three no-map rows keep `sector = null` in
data (no forced merge — the honesty point of the mapping). In **sector views**
(allocation-by-sector, sector rollups) these null-sector holdings are **not
hidden**: they are collected into an explicit **"Not sector-classified
(non-equity)"** bucket (GLOSSARY). Their allocation is already carried by
`asset_class`; the bucket makes the null visible rather than silently dropping
rows from a sector chart.

**Tag (D-011).** Uniqueness is **case-insensitive**; rename **cascades to all
tagged holdings**; the 16-tags-per-holding cap is retained. `holding_key` is the
instrument symbol or manual-asset label.

**Currency (§3)** is a reference master too, but seed-managed under the
FX-translatability rule rather than freely user-added in v2 (user-requestable
additions are ROADMAP R-2).

---

## 7. Admin-screen requirements (per user-extensible master)

Each extensible master needs an admin surface. Common requirements:

- **Institution** — create, rename, **merge** (fold duplicate into a survivor,
  re-pointing every referencing `accounts.institution` / `insurance_policy.insurer`
  row). **Delete blocked while any row references it** (FK guard); offer merge
  instead.
- **Sector** — create, rename, merge. Delete blocked while any instrument
  references it. Ships pre-seeded with the 11 GICS sectors (§6, PROPOSED).
- **Tag** — create, rename (**cascades** to every tagged holding), **dedupe/merge**
  for case and whitespace variants. Enforce case-insensitive uniqueness and the
  16-per-holding cap at write time.
- **Currency** — view the master and each row's `is_base_eligible`; the
  base-currency picker is restricted to eligible rows. New transaction
  currencies are gated behind the FX-translatability rule (and are ROADMAP R-2).

Fixed vocabularies (§2) have **no admin screen** — they are code-defined and
change only by code + migration.

---

## 8. Migration dispositions (recorded in DECISIONS.md)

| Field / concern | Disposition | Decision |
|-----------------|-------------|----------|
| `instruments.country`, `instruments.domicile_country` (free text) | **Dropped.** `listing_country` (ISO2) is authoritative. | D-007 |
| Legacy free-text country values → ISO2 | Map to ISO-3166 alpha-2 with a **manual review list for unmappables — no silent best-guess.** | D-007 |
| `instruments.asset_category` (free text) | **Dropped.** Migration first moves surviving `asset_category` values **into tags**, then drops the column. | D-009 |
| Tag variants | **Dedupe/merge pass** for case and whitespace variants before enforcing case-insensitive uniqueness. | D-011 |
| Currency lists | Collapse the 3 divergent lists into the one master (§3), each member FX-validated. | D-006 |
| Instrument symbol entry | Free-text symbol entry replaced by an **instrument picker** (typeahead + provider search); explicit "create new instrument" path replaces silent auto-creation; `_get_or_create_instrument` side effects removed from GET paths. | D-012 |
| Bulk imports | Same resolution logic with a **review queue for unresolved symbols** — imports never silently auto-create instruments. | D-012 |
| Account entity assignment | Migration assigns every existing account to a default entity (schema already present, 02 §3 rev. `entities`). | 02 §2.2 |

---

## 9. Blocked extractions

**None.** All DEF items are closed:

- **DEF-1, DEF-3, DEF-4, DEF-5** — resolved by verbatim extraction from the
  legacy v1 source (cites in the footer); filled into §2/§3.
- **DEF-2** (`asset_subclass`) and **DEF-6** (sector seed) — **authored, not
  extracted** (no enum / no list exists in code). Both are now proposed in place:
  DEF-2 as the 6-value per-value table in §2 (†), DEF-6 as the 11 GICS sectors +
  migration mapping in §6 (†). Every authored value is tagged **PROPOSED** and is
  ratified at review (same regime as the DESIGN-SYSTEM tokens).
- **DEF-7** (Review thresholds) — not master data; reconciled against
  `services/review.py` in PRODUCT-SPEC §5.

---

## 10. Transaction-type applicability matrix (D-090 — **PROPOSED**)

**Status: every cell is PROPOSED — ratify before enforcement** (owner,
2026-07-10; Holdings page-build §9-17). This table states which `TxnType`s the
Add-flow **Type dropdown offers per `AssetClass`**. It is **form-level filtering
only — the engine is unchanged** (`compute_fifo` processes every type
regardless; this narrows what the UI *offers*). Derived from (a) engine behaviour
and (b) financial reality, with the owner's guidance folded in (Indian mutual
funds have splits + bonus units; interest → FD/bond/cash; dividend →
equity/ETF/MF; merger/split/bonus → provider-quoted securities).

Legend: ✓ = offered · — = not offered. Columns: Buy · Sell · Div(idend) ·
Int(erest) · Dep(osit) · W(ithdrawal) · Fee · Spl(it) · Bon(us) · M(erger) ·
X(fer/transfer).

| AssetClass | Buy | Sell | Div | Int | Dep | W | Fee | Spl | Bon | M | X |
|------------|:---:|:----:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:-:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:-:|:-:|
| equity | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | — | — | — | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| etf | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | — | — | — | ✓ | ✓ | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| mutual_fund | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | — | — | — | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| bond | ✓ | ✓ | — | ✓ | — | — | ✓ | — | — | — | ✓ |
| cash | — | — | — | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | — | — | — | ✓ |
| fixed_deposit | — | — | — | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | — | — | — | ✓ |
| commodity | ✓ | ✓ | — | — | — | — | ✓ | — | — | — | ✓ |
| crypto | ✓ | ✓ | — | — | — | — | ✓ | — | — | — | ✓ |
| property | ✓ | ✓ | — | — | — | — | ✓ | — | — | — | ✓ |
| private | ✓ | ✓ | — | — | — | — | ✓ | — | — | — | ✓ |
| retirement | — | — | — | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | — | — | — | ✓ |
| liability | — | — | — | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | — | — | — | ✓ |
| other | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

**Rationale + judgment calls to ratify:**
- **Dividend** → equity/ETF/mutual_fund only (owner). **Interest** → bond, cash,
  fixed_deposit (owner) + retirement, liability (debts/accounts accrue interest)
  — *the last two are judgment calls to confirm*.
- **Split/Bonus/Merger** → provider-quoted securities. Bonus is **on** for
  mutual_fund (Indian MF bonus units, owner) and equity, **off** for ETF.
  **Crypto corporate actions are OFF** (a judgment call — crypto is
  provider-quoted but token redenominations are atypical; enable on request).
- **Buy/Sell** → acquirable/tradeable classes; **off** for pure balances
  (cash, FD, retirement, liability). **Fee/Transfer** → all (any holding can
  incur a standalone charge or move between accounts).
- **Implementation note:** the Type dropdown lives in the **Listed** Add branch
  (equity/ETF, mutual_fund, crypto today). Rows for **manually-valued** classes
  (FD/bond/cash interest, retirement/liability flows) imply a **transaction path
  on the Manual branch** that does not exist yet — **ratifying those rows also
  approves adding that path** (still no engine change).

## 11. Per-class creation-time fields (D-091 — **PROPOSED**)

**Status: PROPOSED — ratify before enforcement** (owner, 2026-07-10;
page-holdings §9-18). **REQUIRED** = only what valuation/honesty need;
**OPTIONAL-PROMPTED** = offered at creation, never a hard wall. The optional set
starts from the existing D-049 backend whitelist `_META_KEYS`
(`app/api/v1/routes/portfolio.py:466`); **verified present** unless flagged
**(gap)**.

| AssetClass | REQUIRED | OPTIONAL-PROMPTED (from `_META_KEYS` unless noted) |
|------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------|
| equity / etf / mutual_fund / crypto *(Listed)* | instrument, txn fields (qty/price or amount) | instrument-level taxonomy lives on the instrument, not here |
| bond *(Manual)* | label, value, currency | issuer, **coupon**, **maturity_date**, face_value, clean/dirty_price, accrued_interest |
| fixed_deposit | label, value, currency | **rate**, **maturity_date**, start_date, payout_frequency, principal, accrued_interest, maturity_value, issuer, renewal_reminder |
| property | label (name), value, currency | address, valuation_date, valuation_source, next_review_date, **cost (gap — add to `_META_KEYS`)** |
| retirement | label, value, currency | scheme_name, statement_date, contribution_balance, valuation_source |
| private | label (name), value, currency | company, ownership, valuation_date, valuation_source, next_review_date, **round (gap — add to `_META_KEYS`)** |
| cash | label, value, currency | issuer |
| commodity / liability / other | label, value, currency | valuation_date, valuation_source, note (base keys, always allowed) |

**Findings (owner's verification list):**
- **Already present** in the backend whitelist: FD rate/maturity, bond
  coupon/maturity, property address/valuation-date, retirement scheme,
  private company/ownership, cash issuer. Property/private **name** = the
  holding `label`.
- **Missing (gaps to add to `_META_KEYS`):** property **`cost`** (acquisition
  cost) and private-asset **`round`** (funding round). Backend whitelist change,
  no schema change (`meta` is JSON).
- **Frontend gap:** the Manual Add form currently collects **none** of these
  (label/class/value/currency only). The D-091 reshape adds the per-class
  OPTIONAL-PROMPTED fields; the backend already persists them (minus the 2 gaps).
- **Review signal (PROPOSED, new):** incomplete optional details surface as a
  **low-priority** Review item — *"N holdings have incomplete details"* — **never
  a hard wall** (proposed constant `_INCOMPLETE_DETAILS_MIN = 1`; on ratification
  it joins PRODUCT-SPEC §5, per-signal try/except like the rest, D-059).

**Derived from:** `docs/audit/02-DATA-MODEL.md`, `docs/audit/06-UI-AND-TERMINOLOGY-AUDIT.md`
§(a), `docs/audit/DECISIONS.md`, and the **legacy v1 source**
(`~/Documents/github/LedgerFrame`, read-only) for the DEF backfill:

- DEF-1 currency union — `app/core/config.py:18` (`SUPPORTED_CURRENCIES`, 9,
  base-eligible); `frontend/src/lib/refdata.ts:8` (`CURRENCIES`, 14);
  `frontend/src/components/PortfolioEditor.tsx:22` (inline list, 21 unique);
  FX-translatability behaviour `app/services/ecb_fx.py:24,71-73`, `app/services/fx.py:51`.
- DEF-3 `ACCOUNT_KINDS` — `app/services/accounts.py:24`.
- DEF-4 `POLICY_TYPES` / `FREQUENCIES` — `app/services/insurance.py:23-25`.
- DEF-5 `DOC_CATEGORIES` / `CONTACT_ROLES` (+ `WILL_STATUSES`, `DOC_STATUSES`
  confirmation) — `app/services/estate.py:19-22`.
- DEF-2 `asset_subclass` reads/assignments — `app/providers/market/router.py:123,128-145`,
  `app/services/market.py:112,417,433`, `app/api/v1/routes/{amfi.py:75,coingecko.py:89,kite.py:94,97}`,
  migration `a3d21f7e5b10_phase2_identity_taxonomy.py:70`.
- DEF-6 sector reference (`_SECTOR_MAP`) — `app/services/portfolio.py:30-51`.

**DEF-2 and DEF-6 are authored, not extracted (†):** no `asset_subclass` enum
and no sector/GICS list exist in code, so their values are **proposed** here
(§2/§6), each tagged **PROPOSED**, and ratified at review — the code cites above
are the *observed* values/consumers the authoring builds on, not a definition to
copy. Everything else in this file is extracted verbatim.

Decision IDs applied: D-005, D-006, D-007, D-008, D-009, D-010, D-011, D-012,
D-013, D-018, D-049, D-055, D-064, D-073, and the DEFERRED table, plus **Batch 12:
D-082 (non-equity sector bucket, §6), D-083 (six-bucket region mapping, §4),
D-085 (class=exposure / subclass=wrapper, §2), D-087 (`other` escape valve, §2)**. Where the audit
flagged free-text fields that "should" reference masters (02 §4), DECISIONS.md's
verdicts govern the choice of fixed-vocabulary vs extensible-master.

## Needs decision

No product decisions and no extractions outstanding. DEF-2 (`asset_subclass`, §2)
and DEF-6 (sector seed, §6) are **authored proposals** awaiting **ratification at
review** — the same regime as the DESIGN-SYSTEM tokens. Ratify or amend the
PROPOSED-tagged values there.
