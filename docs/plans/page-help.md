# page-help — build plan

**Status: DRAFTED TO §9 (2026-07-19). PLAN ONLY — no code. STOP at §9 pending the owner one-pass.**

Help is **release-blocking** (`release-readiness.md:532`, **Gate C2**, RD-9). This plan is the house
`TEMPLATE-page-build.md` filled from the specs, stopping at §9, after a **verify-first pass** over what
`GET /api/v1/help` actually serves and what its honesty guards are.

> **⚠ Citation correction (2026-07-19).** The SCOPE-NOTES header called verify-first "**D-019**".
> `docs/audit/DECISIONS.md:209-215` shows **D-019 is "Merger recording in the transaction form"** —
> unrelated. **Verify-first is a `TEMPLATE-page-build.md` plan-file rule, not a numbered decision.** Every
> citation in this plan is corrected accordingly; the misattribution is logged as **§9-11** so it is fixed
> wherever else it was copied, not just here. *(A spec claim must cite the thing it actually names —
> page-heatmap §13-2.)*

Help **IS an IA page** (unlike R-38/R-42/R-43, which were platform milestones) — it has a route, a nav
slot, and a page template already assigned in the specs. So the full template applies.

The **SCOPE-NOTES (SN-1)** at the foot of this file are owner rulings recorded ahead of the draft. They are
**inputs to §9, not resolutions of it**, and they are preserved verbatim.

---

## 0. VERIFY-FIRST PASS — what is actually there

*Read before assuming. **Four** premises — in the brief, in Gate C2, and in the SCOPE-NOTES — diverge from
what the code and specs actually hold. Each is flagged **⚠** and carried into §9 (TEMPLATE §3 divergence
rule). The KB as served today is **41 entries: Pages 11 · Terms 29 · About 1**.*

### 0-A ⚠ DIVERGENCE — the `[Help]` popovers do NOT point at `/help`. Nothing does.

Gate C2's justification reads: *"The `[Help]` popovers already ship across built pages and point at a page
that **does not exist**"* (`release-readiness.md:532`). **The second half is not true of the code.**

`GlossaryTerm` (`frontend/src/components/ui/GlossaryTerm.tsx:16-42`) is a **self-contained hover/focus
tooltip**: a `<span role="button">` whose open state renders a `<span role="tooltip">` carrying
`entry.term` + `entry.definition` from `frontend/src/mocks/glossary.ts`. It contains **no `<a>`, no `to`,
no `href`, and no `/help`**. A grep for "See Help" / "Learn more" style copy across `frontend/src` returns
**nothing**.

The only `/help` references in the frontend are:

| File:line | What |
|---|---|
| `frontend/src/components/ui/nav.ts:64` | `{ label: "Help", path: "/help" }` — **no `built: true`** |
| `frontend/src/components/ui/Sidebar.tsx:73` | `group.items.filter((i) => i.built)` — so Help is **filtered out of the rendered sidebar** |
| `frontend/src/AppRoutes.tsx:64` | `<Route path="*" element={<NotBuilt />} />` — `/help` falls through to the honest fallback |
| `frontend/src/components/ui/chrome.test.tsx:48` | asserts `queryByRole("link", { name: "Help" })` is **null** — the absence is currently a *pinned* invariant |
| `frontend/src/components/AppShell.test.tsx:346` | renders `/help`, asserts it is unbuilt |

**So the live defect is not a dead link.** It is: **a spec'd IA page (`INFORMATION-ARCHITECTURE.md:85`)
with a fully-served backend, a reserved route, and a reserved nav slot — that has no page.** Users cannot
reach help at all; the popovers are terminal (definition only, nowhere to go deeper).

**This makes the milestone easier, not harder** — there is no dead-end retrofit to unwind. §9-1 changes
shape accordingly: it is a **target list for ADDING popovers + adding the deeper-reading path**, not for
retiring dead ones. The one genuinely dead affordance is listed in 0-D.

### 0-B ⚠ DIVERGENCE — `GET /api/v1/help` already EXISTS, is in the frozen contract, and is UNCONSUMED

| File:line | What |
|---|---|
| `app/api/v1/routes/system.py:745-752` | `@router.get("/help")`, `help_content(q: str \| None = None) -> dict`; delegates to `all_help()` / `search_help(q, limit=6)`. Docstring: *"In-app help — all entries, or ranked results for a query. Read-only, no secrets."* |
| `app/services/help.py:12` | `HELP: list[dict]` — a ~550-line structured KB, **41 entries**, categories `Pages` · `Terms` · `About` |
| `app/services/help.py:519-527` | `all_help()` → `{"categories": [...], "entries": [...]}`; projects `what`/`why`/`improves` **only** onto Terms entries |
| `app/services/help.py:529-544` | `search_help(query, limit)` — title/keyword-weighted ranking |
| `docs/specs/API-CONTRACT.json:5909`, `docs/openapi.json:5909` | `/api/v1/help` **is in the frozen contract** |
| `tests/integration/test_help.py` | 9 tests — id uniqueness, Terms triads non-empty, term-set coverage, **an advice-free phrasing guard**, projection shape, search ranking, endpoint, AI grounding |

**No frontend client exists.** `docs/audit/03-API-SURFACE.md:51` names the expected binding `helpContent`;
grep finds **zero** hits in `frontend/src/api/`. The KB is served and nothing reads it.

**Consequence — the fast-path MOSTLY applies (TEMPLATE §1 note, page-pricing-health §13):** every reader
this page needs **already exists and needs no new endpoint**. But the fast-path does **not** fully clear
§3b here: reading the contract *entry* (not just its presence) shows the response shape is **unpinned**
(§3a) — so §3b carries **one reshape row** and Phase 0 is a small backend-first commit, not a skip. The
bulk of the work is frontend assembly + a **content-accuracy pass on the served strings**.

> *Worth stating as a rule: "the endpoint is in the frozen contract" is **not** the same as "its shape is
> frozen". The fast-path test is whether the contract PINS what the page will render — check the entry,
> not the index.*

### 0-C ⚠ DIVERGENCE — the served help content is **v1-era and factually stale**

The KB's `Pages` entries describe an IA **this product no longer has**. Verified against
`INFORMATION-ARCHITECTURE.md §2` and `nav.ts`:

| `help.py` entry | Claim | Reality |
|---|---|---|
| `page-snapshot:41` | a page called **"Snapshot"** | v2 has **Net worth** (`/net-worth`); `/snapshot` is a *redirect*, not a page (`nav.ts:5-7`) |
| `page-planning:51` | a page called **"Planning"** with goals + obligations | v2 split this into **Cash flow** and **Scenarios**; `/planning` is a redirect |
| `page-policy:45` | titled **"Investment policy"** | v2's nav label / H1 / route is **Policy** (D-022: nav label = H1 = route) |
| `page-pricing-health:35` | titled **"Pricing health"** | v2 spells it **Pricing Health** (`nav.ts:57`) — capital H |
| `page-reports:56` | *"Realised gains by year"* | **D-026 deprecated "Realised gains"**; the ratified term is **Realised P/L report** (`glossary.ts:54`) |
| `page-home:14` | *"the top-bar **Simple/Expert** toggle"* | D-046/D-047 ratified **Simple / Full** |
| `page-planning:51` | *"Edit an item with the **✎** button"* | page-policy §13-2 records the pencil icon as a **silent no-op edit** that never shipped |
| — | no entry exists for | **Accounts · Heatmap · Review · Insurance · Estate · Scenarios · Cash flow · Legal** |

**Every claim in help copy must match ratified behaviour** (standing block). As served, a large fraction
does not. **The content-accuracy pass is the bulk of this milestone**, and it is what §9-5 scopes.

### 0-D — the one genuinely dead affordance: `term-*` entries that render nowhere

`frontend/src/mocks/glossary.ts` holds **63 entries; 22 render at no site** (dead popover data):
`term-intraday`, `term-interval`, `term-snapshot`, `term-backfill`, `term-report`, `term-rollup`,
`term-merge`, `term-monthly-equivalent`, `term-goal-progress`, `term-policy-investment`,
`term-cost-basis`, `term-unrealised-pl`, `term-data-confidence`, `term-mark-reviewed`, `term-severity`,
`term-home`, `term-will`, `term-executor`, `term-beneficiary`, `term-guardian`,
`term-emergency-contact`, `term-readiness`.

`tests/unit/test_glossary_parity.py:52-58` is **one-way** (popover → spec: `f"**{term}**" in spec`). It
does not check the reverse, does not check ids or definitions, and **cannot see a term that renders
nowhere** — all 22 pass. This is the "one truth in two stores" lesson (TEMPLATE, page-heatmap §13-1)
with the guard pointing in only one direction. → **§9-8**.

### 0-E — THE THREE-STORE PROBLEM (the finding that most shapes this plan)

There are **three** term stores, not the two the specs name:

| # | Store | Role | Guarded? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `docs/specs/GLOSSARY.md` | canonical spec (**300** bolded terms) | — |
| 2 | `frontend/src/mocks/glossary.ts` | what `[Help]` popovers render (**63** ids, flat `definition`) | parity → store 1, one-way |
| 3 | `app/services/help.py` `category: "Terms"` | what `/help` serves **and what the AI cites** (**29** ids, `what`/`why`/`improves` triad) | `test_help.py` shape/phrasing only — **no parity to store 1 or 2** |

Stores 2 and 3 share **2 ids out of 90** (`term-concentration`, `term-unrealised-pl`). They are
**near-disjoint vocabularies with silent aliases** for the same concept:

- `term-cash-runway` (fe) ↔ `term-runway` (be)
- `term-data-confidence` (fe) ↔ `term-confidence` (be)
- `term-realised-pl` (fe) ↔ `term-realised-gains` (be) — **and the backend id/title carries the D-026
  deprecated wording**

And **17 of the 29 backend Terms titles are absent from `GLOSSARY.md`**, so adopting them wholesale as
popover data would fail the parity guard for: *Entitlement & stale · XIRR & TWR · Realised gains & tax
lots · FIFO (first-in, first-out) · Total value · Income (dividends & interest) · 1-year return · 1-year
volatility · Maximum drawdown (1-year) · Allocation weights · Beta · Correlation · Downside deviation ·
Information ratio · Tracking error · HHI (concentration) · Estimated ongoing cost*.

Several of those are **entry titles, not glossary terms** ("XIRR & TWR" is a compound heading). That is a
**structural** mismatch: *a help entry title is not a glossary term*, and the plan must not pretend
otherwise. → **§9-2** is the load-bearing decision of this milestone.

### 0-F — blast radius: the KB is AI-grounded

`app/ai/tools.py:145-148` calls `search_help(question, limit=3)` and emits the results as
`fact_type="help"` in the grounded fact pack; `test_help.py` pins it
(`test_ai_facts_grounded_in_help`). `app/services/help.py:3-7` states the KB is *"a single structured
source of truth used by BOTH the Help page (`GET /help`) and the AI"*.

**So the 0-C content rewrite changes what the AI cites as fact.** AI-surfaces (D-067/D-068) is milestone
#3 in `CURRENT.md`'s THEN list — after Help. Correcting stale content **before** that milestone is the
right order (the AI should not be grounded in v1 page names), but it is a **cross-milestone touch** and
must be declared. → **§9-9**.

### 0-G — **GLOSSARY.md already declares the Help catalogue's contract — and 44 entries are missing**

`docs/specs/GLOSSARY.md:7-8`, in the normative preamble, verbatim:

> *"Terms marked **[Help]** have a full what/why/improves entry in the in-app Help catalogue."*

So the **spec already defines the relationship** between the glossary and the Help KB, and already
specifies the entry shape (`what` / `why` / `improves` — exactly the triad `all_help()` projects onto
Terms entries, `help.py:519-527`). **This is not a model this plan needs to invent.** It exists.

But the spec's obligation is **unmet by a wide margin**:

| Measure | Count |
|---|---|
| Canonical terms in `GLOSSARY.md` (10 topical sections) | **133** |
| Terms **marked `[Help]`** — i.e. promised a what/why/improves entry | **73** |
| Terms entries actually served by `help.py` | **29** |
| **Promised but not served** | **≈44** |

`GLOSSARY.md` also carries **23 deprecated-term rows** with replacements and deciding IDs — the exact
table needed to catch 0-C's D-026 "Realised gains" defect mechanically.

**Two consequences.** First, **§9-2 is much less open than it looked**: the spec already names
`GLOSSARY.md` as the parent and the `[Help]` mark as the join key; the plan's job is to *enforce* an
existing rule, not choose a new one. Second, **§9-5's scope is now bounded by a real number** — 44 missing
entries — and shipping all 44 at v2.0.0 is almost certainly wrong for a release-blocking milestone. That
is the tier split §9-5 asks the owner to rule.

**Also noted:** some `[Help]` marks carry **PROPOSED** provenance rather than RATIFIED (e.g. `:310` Home,
*"PROPOSED 2026-07-13, page-home §9-13 — ratify at the walk"*). The `[Help]` mark is therefore **not
uniformly a ratified promise**, which matters when counting what is actually owed. → **§9-5**.

### 0-H — the popover inventory (the survey the brief calls load-bearing)

**41 render sites** across 14 route files. Full table in **§10**. Summary by page:

| Page | On-page `[Help]` sites |
|---|---|
| Policy | 7 · Insurance | 6 · Home | 3 · Reports | 3 · CashFlow | 3 |
| Settings | 2 direct + 5 via `Field helpTerm` · Accounts | 2 · News | 2 · Heatmap | 2 · Scenarios | 2 |
| Markets | 1 · Estate | 1 · Review | 1 |
| KitchenSink | 4 (gallery specimens, not a product page) |
| **Holdings** | **0 on-page** — its only affordance is `ConfirmDialog helpTerm="term-purge"` (`Holdings.tsx:616`), inside a destructive modal |
| **Portfolio · Instrument Detail · Net worth · Pricing Health** | **0** |
| **Chrome** (`AppShell.tsx`, all `components/ui/*` except `ConfirmDialog`) | **0** |

**This confirms SN-1's owner-picked target list empirically** (Holdings, Instrument Detail, Portfolio,
chrome) **and extends it by two the owner did not name: Net worth and Pricing Health** — both built,
accepted, and popover-free. The extension is offered for the owner to confirm or trim, not assumed. →
**§9-1 ⚑**.

## 1. IDENTITY

*Source: INFORMATION-ARCHITECTURE.md §2/§3; DESIGN-SYSTEM.md §3.*

| Field | Value | Spec ref |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Page name (H1 = nav label = route) | **Help** | `INFORMATION-ARCHITECTURE.md:85`, D-022 |
| Route | `/help` | `INFORMATION-ARCHITECTURE.md:85`; already reserved at `nav.ts:64` |
| Nav group | **System** (Settings · Help · Legal) | `INFORMATION-ARCHITECTURE.md:109` |
| Page template | **Settings** template — *"Sectioned/tabbed configuration or content pages in the System group. Settings, Help, Legal"* | `DESIGN-SYSTEM.md:230` (verbatim) |
| Rotation eligibility | **Not eligible** — System-group utility page, not a rotation surface (D-044) | IA §3 |
| One-line purpose | *"Searchable knowledge base (pages + terms + guarantees)."* | `INFORMATION-ARCHITECTURE.md:85` (verbatim) |

**The template is already assigned — do not re-litigate it.** `DESIGN-SYSTEM.md:230` names Help
explicitly under the **Settings** template. This settles the "topic index vs single page" half of the
brief's §9-3: a Settings-template page is **sectioned**, and the served `categories`
(`Pages` · `Terms` · `About`) are the sections. What remains open is the *deep-link mechanism* → §9-3.

**The IA purpose line also settles the brief's §9-6:** search is **not** an invented feature and **not**
absent from the spec — `INFORMATION-ARCHITECTURE.md:85` says **"Searchable"**, and `search_help()` is
already built and tested. Help **must** be searchable.

---

## 2. OWNERSHIP TABLE

*Source: INFORMATION-ARCHITECTURE.md §5. P-1: one canonical page per piece of information.*

> **⚠ SPEC SILENCE — IA §5 has no Help subsection.** The per-page canonical-ownership sections run
> Reports (`:347`) · Reports Pack (`:357`) · Pricing Health (`:364`) · Settings (`:373`) · Instrument
> Detail (`:396`) · Global chrome (`:404`). **Help and Legal are absent.** Help has a page-map row
> (`:85`) and a nav slot (`:109`) but **no ownership entry anywhere in the IA**. The table below is
> therefore **derived, not copied** — which the template forbids doing silently. → **§9-14**.

**Owns (canonical, authoritative):**
- **The help knowledge base itself** — the `Pages` / `Terms` / `About` entries served by
  `GET /api/v1/help`. This is the only page that renders the KB in full.
- **Nothing else.** Help owns **no figure, no money value, no user record.**

**Summarises (other pages' information — pointer only, never a second home):**

| Summary shown | Canonical page | Shared reader reused | Link target |
|---|---|---|---|
| What each page is for (`Pages` entries) | each page itself | `GET /api/v1/help` (`category: "Pages"`) | that page's route |
| What each term means (`Terms` entries) | `docs/specs/GLOSSARY.md` (spec) / the page that shows the term | `GET /api/v1/help` (`category: "Terms"`) | the owning page |
| The product guarantees (`About`) | `PRODUCT-SPEC.md` §0 guarantees | `GET /api/v1/help` (`category: "About"`) | — |

**Enforcement corollary (P-1 / D-031) — how this page honours it.** Help is a **reader and a pointer,
never a second home**. Concretely, the binding rule this plan adopts:

> **Help describes what a page is FOR and what a term MEANS. It never restates a page's figures, never
> carries a number, and never duplicates a procedure that the page itself owns.** A help entry that finds
> itself explaining *how to compute* something is out of scope; it links to the page that computes it.

**Help carries no money and no live figures at all** — so D-105 (which binds *all* money display,
`DECISIONS.md:793-794`) is **N/A by construction**. Recording the absence keeps it a chosen decision, not
a missed standard (the page-estate §9-3 precedent). A guard asserts no money-formatted string renders on
`/help` → §7.

**Links to:** every built page (from its `Pages` entry) · Settings · Legal.

## 3. API SURFACE

### 3a. Endpoints consumed (already in the frozen contract)

| Method + path | Purpose on this page | Response shape pinned? |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/v1/help` | full KB — `{"categories": [...], "entries": [{id, category, title, body, what?, why?, improves?}]}` | **⚠ NO** — see below |
| `GET /api/v1/help?q=` | ranked search — `{"query": q, "entries": [{id, category, title, body}]}` (≤6) | **⚠ NO** — see below |

**⚠ DIVERGENCE (0-B follow-on) — the contract entry exists but pins NOTHING.** The route is declared
`-> dict` (`system.py:746`), so `API-CONTRACT.json:5909` records the `200` response as an **untyped free
object**: `{"type": "object", "additionalProperties": true}`, title `Response Help Content Api V1 Help
Get`. The endpoint is *in* the frozen contract while its **shape is not frozen at all** — squarely
TEMPLATE §9's *"missing/ambiguous contract shape"* category.

Today only `tests/integration/test_help.py` holds the shape, and it asserts the **service functions**, not
the wire format. A frontend page built against an unpinned dict has no contract protection: a field could
be renamed or dropped and **the contract check would stay green**. → **§9-12**.

**Honesty guards audited (TEMPLATE §3 "audit GUARDS, not just shapes", page-news §13a):**
- **No egress.** The KB is a static in-process list; `help_content` makes no network call, so there is no
  `privacy_mode` obligation to check. ✅
- **No secrets.** The route is unauthenticated and read-only by design (docstring, `system.py:747`); no
  entry carries a credential, path, or token. ✅
- **Advice-free.** `test_help.py:65-71` already asserts no Terms entry contains *"you should" / "aim for"
  / "a good value" / "we recommend"*. ✅ — but it covers **Terms only**; `Pages` and `About` bodies are
  unguarded. → **§9-7**.
- **Accuracy.** **No guard at all.** Nothing asserts a `Pages` entry names a page that exists. This is
  exactly how 0-C's stale content survived. → **§9-7**.

### 3b. Contract deltas

**ONE row — a reshape, not an addition.** The endpoint exists and needs no new reader; what it lacks is a
pinned shape.

| kind | Endpoint (current → intended) | Decision | Why this page needs it |
|---|---|---|---|
| **reshape** | `GET /api/v1/help` — untyped `-> dict` → a declared `response_model` (`HelpEntry` / `HelpResponse`) | **§9-12** | The page renders served strings verbatim; without a pinned shape a renamed field breaks the page while the contract check stays green |

> **⚠ `response_model` STRIPS undeclared keys (TEMPLATE §3b note, page-markets §12mk3-2:
> `HoldingView.price_display`).** Terms entries carry `what`/`why`/`improves` **conditionally** —
> `all_help()` omits them on non-Terms entries (`help.py:521-524`). A naive model would either **strip
> the triad entirely** or force it onto entries that must not have it. The model must make the three
> fields **`Optional`, excluded when unset**, and `test_help.py:73`'s
> `test_all_help_surfaces_glossary_for_terms_only` must be **extended to the wire response**, not just
> the service projection — otherwise the very guard that proves the projection would keep passing while
> the endpoint stopped serving it.

**So Phase 0 is NOT skipped** — it is one small backend-first commit, regenerating `API-CONTRACT.json` +
`docs/openapi.json` in the **same commit** (freeze rule). *(An earlier draft of this plan called §3b empty
on the strength of "the endpoint is in the contract". Reading the contract entry itself corrected it —
which is the whole point of verify-first.)*

> **Note (TEMPLATE §3b, page-review §13):** the content corrections in 0-C change **served values, not
> shapes** — they regenerate no contract, so *a spec edit alone would leave the code free to silently
> disagree*. Therefore **every ratified content rule ships a same-batch, fail-first code test** pinning
> the served value (§7, §9-7). This is the mechanism that replaces the missing contract regen.

## 4. COMPONENTS

*Source: DESIGN-SYSTEM.md §5 (ratified inventory). Every component below is already ratified — **no
DESIGN-SYSTEM amendment is required for this page**.*

| Ratified component | Role on this page | Data source | Prop/state not exercised at kitchen-sink |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PageHeader` | H1 "Help" + the purpose line | static | — |
| `TextInput` (`ui/index.ts:13`) | the **search field** (`?q=`) | **real** — `GET /help?q=` | debounced-search usage is new; no new prop |
| `Segmented` (`ui/index.ts:46`) | category filter — Pages / Terms / About | **real** — served `categories` | — |
| `.lf-card` + `.lf-card__body` (D-100) | one card per category section; entry bodies nest in the inner panel | **real** | — |
| `EmptyState` | "no results for «q»" with a reason (Guarantee 3) | — | — |
| `Skeleton` | per-section load state (progressive, TEMPLATE §12-8) | — | — |
| `GlossaryTerm` | **unchanged**; the retrofit adds *sites*, not a new component | `mocks/glossary.ts` | — |
| `Button` | "clear search" | — | — |

**Data source (Holdings retrospective).** The page itself is wired **entirely to a real endpoint** — there
is **no mock-backed affordance on `/help`**. ✅

**⚠ But the popover retrofit IS mock-backed**, and stays so: `GlossaryTerm` reads
`frontend/src/mocks/glossary.ts` (a bundled fixture), not `/help`. Under TEMPLATE §4 that is a **§9
NEEDS DECISION ("mock-backed affordance")** — and it is the same decision as the three-store problem. →
**§9-2**.

**⚠ Affordances the ratified inventory lacks — an honest reading.** A grep of `DESIGN-SYSTEM.md` for
`long-form | prose | topic index | content-heavy | Markdown` returns **exactly one hit: line 547, the
GlossaryTerm row.** There is **no prose/article/accordion/table-of-contents/search-results component in
the ratified inventory**, and Help is the product's only prose page. Two readings:

- **(i) No amendment needed** — an entry is a **title + body paragraph inside `.lf-card__body`**, which is
  composition of ratified primitives, not a new component. `DESIGN-SYSTEM.md §3.1` explicitly sanctions
  the one thing prose needs: *"A page may still cap an inner content **MEASURE** (a reading column inside
  a card…) — that is component-local, not the page root."* So a readable line-length is **already
  allowed** without an amendment.
- **(ii) An amendment is needed** — a search-results list and a category filter are recurring affordances
  that will want a home in the component layer (TEMPLATE §4: *"extract page-local patterns that recur"*).

**Proposed: (i) for the build, with (ii) deferred** — build from ratified primitives, and if the prose
block or results list proves reusable at the walk, extract it **then**, at its second site, per the
centralisation rule. **Recorded rather than assumed** → **§9-13**. *(An earlier draft asserted "no
amendment required" flatly; the DESIGN-SYSTEM grep does not support that confidence.)*

**No templating engine exists anywhere in the stack** — the Reports Pack composes HTML by f-string, and
`reports-pack.md:163-176` records *"No Jinja2 / templates precedent exists… Adding Jinja2 would need an
ADR"*. **Help bodies are therefore plain text, not Markdown**, and no renderer is introduced (CLAUDE.md:
no new dependencies without an ADR).

**Component rules this build must honour:** popovers portal to the viewport and overlay (DESIGN-SYSTEM
§6); scroll is content-only with the header outside (D-101); cards are layered (D-100); a card's
cross-link lives in the **header, top-right** (`SummaryLink`, DESIGN-SYSTEM:545) — which is how a `Pages`
entry links to its page.

**Tables (D-094):** **none on this page.** The KB is rendered as sectioned cards, not a `DataTable`.
Dataset is **bounded** (41 entries, authored, not user-generated), and **search executes server-side**
(`search_help`), so no client-side filtering of an unbounded set arises.

---

## 4b. PER-VARIANT FIELD & ACTION SPECS

**N/A.** Help has no entity, no variants, no forms, no mutations. The page is **read-only**.

---

## 5. VOCABULARIES

*Source: MASTER-DATA.md.*

| Field on this page | Vocabulary / master | Fixed or extensible | Ref |
|---|---|---|---|
| Help category (Pages / Terms / About) | **served fixed list** — `_CATEGORIES` (`app/services/help.py:516`) | **Fixed**, backend-served | — |

**⚠ Not in MASTER-DATA.md.** The category list is a served constant, not a `/refdata` vocabulary. Per
CLAUDE.md's hard rule (*"every categorical field must reference MASTER-DATA"*) the `Segmented` filter is a
categorical control bound to a list that has no master. Two honest readings — it is a **display grouping**
rather than a data field, or it needs a MASTER-DATA row. → **§9-10**.

**No user input, no `MasterSelect`, no user-record picker.** The only input is the free-text search box,
which is a query, not a categorical field.

## 6. DECISIONS IN FORCE

| Decision | What it forbids / requires on this page |
|---|---|
| **D-022** (nav label = H1 = route) | H1 is exactly **"Help"**, route exactly `/help` — and the served `Pages` titles must use the **same spellings** (0-C violates this today: "Investment policy", "Pricing health", "Snapshot", "Planning") |
| **D-043** (six fixed nav groups) | Help enters **System**, between Settings and Legal — the slot already exists (`nav.ts:64`); no reorder, no new group |
| **Verify-first** (TEMPLATE rule, **not** D-019 — see the header correction) | §0 above; the divergences are flagged ⚠, not built around |
| **page-chrome P-3** (`page-chrome.md:503-511`) | the sidebar density is **already sized for all 19 RD-9 nav items including Help** — *"not redone at Accounts/Settings/Help/Legal"*; `e2e/sidebar-density.spec.ts` reserves the slot. Adding Help **consumes a reserved slot**, it does not force a re-density |
| **Gate C3** (`release-readiness.md:533`) | *"no nav entry in the release build leads to `NotBuilt`"* — a fail-first test. Help's flip must land **with** its page, never before |
| **Dead-affordance principle** (`page-chrome.md:578`) | *"a control wired to nothing is hidden until its engine lands, not shipped"* — which is exactly why `nav.ts:64` is `built:false` today. **The current state is correct behaviour, not a bug** |
| **D-026** (Realised P/L, not "Realised gains") | the served `page-reports` body and the `term-realised-gains` id/title carry the **deprecated** wording — corrected in the content pass |
| **D-046 / D-047** (Simple / Full) | the served `page-home` body says **"Simple/Expert"** — wrong; corrected |
| **D-100 / D-101** (layered cards; scroll = content only) | section cards are layered; only `.lf-shell__content` scrolls |
| **D-105** (money display) | **N/A (chosen)** — Help renders no money; guarded (§2, §7) |
| **D-078** (settings persistence split) | Help persists **nothing** — no per-device state, no server setting. The search query is URL state (`?q=`), not persistence |
| **P-1 / D-031** (one canonical page) | Help **summarises-with-pointers only** (§2) |
| **Guarantee 3** (honesty) | empty search results show a **reason**; a `Pages` entry for an unbuilt page is **not shown** rather than lying |
| **Guarantee (never advises)** | the advice-free phrasing guard extends from Terms to **all** categories (§9-7) |
| **R-39 constraints** (`ROADMAP.md:52`) | **(a)** semantic-only colour; **(b)** no avatar/account block; **(c)** collapse-to-icon rides the **existing D-078 sidebar-collapsed** setting — **none of the three is touched by adding a nav entry**; see §9-4 |

## 7. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

- [ ] **Happy path:** `/help` renders the served KB in three sections (Pages · Terms · About); every entry
      shows title + body; Terms entries additionally show **what / why / improves**.
- [ ] **Search:** typing a query hits `GET /help?q=`, renders ≤6 ranked results, and is **reachable and
      shareable as `?q=` URL state**; clearing restores the full KB.
- [ ] **Deep link:** a `#`-anchored entry id (per §9-3's ruling) scrolls to and visibly marks that entry.
- [ ] **Nav:** **Help appears in the sidebar** under System, between Settings and Legal, at every
      breakpoint and in the collapsed state; it is the **active** item on `/help`.
- [ ] **`chrome.test.tsx:48` is INVERTED, not deleted** — the pinned "Help link is null" invariant becomes
      "Help link is present"; `AppShell.test.tsx:346` picks a still-unbuilt route (Legal) for its
      NotBuilt case. *(A test that pins the defect must be flipped deliberately and be seen to flip.)*
- [ ] **Content accuracy (the milestone's real bar):** **every** `Pages` entry names a page that exists in
      `nav.ts` with the **identical spelling**; no entry references a redirect-only path
      (`/snapshot`, `/planning`, `/global`); no entry uses D-026 / D-046-deprecated wording. Pinned by a
      **fail-first** test (§9-7) that is **seen RED on today's content**.
- [ ] **Advice-free across ALL categories** — the `test_help.py:65` phrasing guard extends beyond Terms,
      proven RED→GREEN.
- [ ] **No money math, no money strings** — a guard asserts no money-formatted string renders on `/help`.
- [ ] **Terms match GLOSSARY** — whatever §9-2 rules, the parity guard covers the store the page renders,
      and is **seen RED** on a deliberately misspelled term.
- [ ] **Empty state:** a no-match search shows a reason, not a blank.
- [ ] **Error state:** an endpoint failure shows an honest message + retry; the page never renders a
      half-KB silently.
- [ ] **Both densities and both themes** correct; **interactive open states** (a popover on `/help`)
      checked in light AND dark.
- [ ] **Keyboard + WCAG AA** — the search field is labelled, the Segmented filter is keyboard-operable,
      focus ring visible, section headings form a correct heading order.
- [ ] **Copy hygiene (page-chrome §11-8):** no decision ID (`D-0…`/`P-…`/`§…`) or implementation note
      (endpoint names, `privacy_mode`, internal enums) in any served or rendered help string. **This page
      is the highest-risk surface for that defect in the product** — it is prose about the product.
- [ ] **Overflow / single scroll region:** `/help` added to `e2e/overflow.spec.ts` — zero horizontal
      overflow at 320/375/900/1366 × both themes; only `.lf-shell__content` scrolls vertically. **Long
      unbroken body text is the specific risk** this page brings.
- [ ] **Cross-page journey (page-accounts §14ac-2):** a `Pages` entry's link is guarded by **clicking the
      real control** and asserting the **destination page state**, not by rendering the destination.
- [ ] **Retrofitted popovers (per §9-1's confirmed list):** each renders on the real page, overlays without
      expanding its container, and its term passes parity.
- [ ] **`npm run check` exit code stated from the frontend directory**; no known-red left on trunk
      (page-insurance §15b(a)).

## 8. BUILD PHASES

*One commit per phase. Backend deltas (§3b) FIRST.*

- **Phase 0 — Contract delta (§3b).** Declare the `response_model` on `GET /api/v1/help` with the triad
  **optional-and-excluded-when-unset**; extend the projection guard to the **wire** response; regenerate
  `API-CONTRACT.json` + `docs/openapi.json` **same commit**; drift check green.
- **Phase 1 — Content pass (BACKEND-FIRST, before any page exists).** Correct the KB in
  `app/services/help.py` per §9-5's ratified scope: fix the stale `Pages` entries (0-C), resolve the
  D-026 / D-046 wording, add entries for the pages with none, and resolve the term-id aliases per §9-2.
  **Each rule ships its fail-first guard in the same commit** (§3b note). `test_help.py:88`'s
  `"Investment policy"` assertion updates in this commit. **Declared AI touch** (§9-9 / 0-F).
- **Phase 2 — Page assembly.** `frontend/src/routes/Help.tsx` + the `helpContent` client
  (`docs/audit/03-API-SURFACE.md:51`); compose the ratified components (§4); progressive per-section
  loading; honest empty/error states; `?q=` URL state; deep-link anchors.
- **Phase 3 — Nav + the pinned-invariant flip.** `nav.ts:64` gains `built: true`; **invert**
  `chrome.test.tsx:48`; repoint `AppShell.test.tsx:346`. *(This is the whole of §9-4's mechanism —
  one flag.)*
- **Phase 4 — `[Help]` retrofit** to §9-1's **owner-confirmed** list. **Every target page is CLOSED and
  ACCEPTED**, so each touched page takes a **dated DELTA NOTE in its own plan file** + a **re-run
  pre-pass** (the page-insurance §14in / page-holdings precedent). Enumerated per page:
  `page-holdings.md` · `page-instrument-detail.md` · `page-portfolio.md` · `page-chrome.md` ·
  *(pending §9-1)* `page-net-worth.md` · `page-pricing-health.md`.
- **Phase 5 — Tests.** §7 criteria; extend `e2e/overflow.spec.ts` with `/help`; the dead-entry guard
  (§9-8); typecheck + lint + drift green; `npm run check` exit 0 from `frontend/`.
- **Phase 6 — Scripted pre-pass (MUST be green before the walk).** Drive `/help` live in both themes
  across breakpoints: search, filter, deep-link, every section out of skeleton, 0 console errors. **Plus
  a re-run of each accepted page's existing pre-pass** touched in Phase 4.
- **Phase 7 — Owner acceptance walk (LIVE) — judgment items only.** **All help copy is PROPOSED until the
  owner ratifies it here** (SN-1: *"Copy is PROPOSED → ratified at the walk"*). This walk is unusually
  copy-heavy: it is the ratification of the product's entire explanatory voice. **The owner closes the
  phase — never self-certify.**
- **Close ritual.** Plan §-retrospective + `RATIFICATION.md §6` row; strike-check every §9/§walk item
  against the actual diff; **`CURRENT.md` must be inside the close commit's diff**; `git push`.

## 9. NEEDS DECISION — **PARTIALLY RESOLVED (one-pass in chat, 2026-07-19)**

*Ruled in chat on **2026-07-19** by the **architect under the owner's standing delegation**, **reversible
by dated entry**. **Five ⚑ items RULED** (9-1, 9-2, 9-5, 9-6, 9-9); **9-11 / 9-12 stand as logged**, and
§3b's reshape row proceeds in Phase 0. Each ruled row carries its **→ RULING** in the final cell; nothing
is struck.*

**Still OPEN — and none blocks Phase 0:** 9-0 · 9-3 · 9-4 · 9-8 · 9-10 · 9-13 · 9-14 · 9-T. They gate
later phases (page assembly, nav flip, retrofit) and are carried to the next pass.

**9-7 proceeds under the PROCEED instruction** (*"the contract reshape row + content-store guard + KB
content pass **per the plan**"*) — its guards are the mechanism the content pass runs on. Recorded here as
**proceeding-per-plan rather than separately ruled**, so the distinction stays visible.

| # | Item | Why it blocks / what's needed | **PROPOSED resolution → RULING (2026-07-19)** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **9-0** | **⚠ Re-baseline Gate C2's premise** | `release-readiness.md:532` says the popovers *"point at a page that does not exist"*. **They point nowhere at all** (0-A) — `GlossaryTerm` has no link. The gate's stated defect is not the real one, and the real one is larger: a spec'd IA page with a served backend and no page. | **Correct the Gate C2 justification line** to the verified defect: *"`/help` is a spec'd IA page (IA:85) with a fully-served backend (`GET /api/v1/help`) and a reserved nav slot, but no page; the `[Help]` popovers are terminal — a definition with nowhere to read further."* Scope is unchanged; only the premise is corrected. **A gate must name the defect it actually gates.** |
| **9-1 ⚑** | **THE TARGET LIST** — which pages get `[Help]`, and which terms | SN-1 rules targets are **owner-picked per page**. The survey (0-H, §10) is the real data to pick from. Four pages named in SN-1 have zero; **two more the owner did not name also have zero**. | **Confirm the SN-1 four** — Holdings (on-page; it has only a modal popover today), Instrument Detail, Portfolio, chrome — **and EXTEND by two: Net worth and Pricing Health** (both built, accepted, popover-free). Per-page candidate terms proposed in **§10-B**, each drawn from terms **already in GLOSSARY.md**. **Owner confirms / trims / extends per page.** *No popover is a dead-end under any trim* — the affordance is a self-contained tooltip (0-A), so a trimmed target simply has no popover; nothing is left pointing anywhere. **This is the ⚑ ruling that unblocks Phase 4.** **→ RULING: ✅ CONFIRMED AS SURVEYED + EXTENDED (2026-07-19)** — SN-1's four **plus Net worth and Pricing Health**. Zero GLOSSARY additions needed for the common case; no trim dead-ends by design. |
| **9-2 ⚑** | **CONTENT MODEL — the three-store problem** (0-E) | The load-bearing decision. Two term stores share **2 ids of 90**, with silent aliases and one D-026-deprecated title; **17 of 29** backend titles fail GLOSSARY parity; and a help **entry title** is structurally not a **glossary term**. The popover is mock-backed (§4). **But 0-G narrows this sharply:** `GLOSSARY.md:7-8` **already** declares the model — *"Terms marked **[Help]** have a full what/why/improves entry in the in-app Help catalogue"* — naming `GLOSSARY.md` as parent and the `[Help]` mark as the join key. The job is to **enforce an existing rule**, not choose a new one. | **SERVED is canonical for the PAGE; BUNDLED stays canonical for the POPOVER — and the two are given ONE spec parent, not merged.** Specifically: **(a)** `/help` renders **only** the served KB (store 3) — the page never reads `mocks/glossary.ts`; **(b)** the `[Help]` popover keeps reading `mocks/glossary.ts` (store 2) — **it is a bundled tooltip on purpose**: it must open instantly, offline, with no request per hover; **(c)** **`GLOSSARY.md` (store 1) becomes the enforced parent of BOTH** — the existing one-way parity guard is extended to cover store 3's `Terms` **`title`** fields too, so all three agree on spelling. **Per 0-G this is enforcement of `GLOSSARY.md:7-8`, already normative — the guard is the mechanism the spec has been missing, and the 23-row deprecated-terms table (`GLOSSARY.md:318`) is the ready-made check that catches the D-026 defect mechanically;** **(d)** the **alias ids are reconciled** (`term-runway`→`term-cash-runway`, `term-confidence`→`term-data-confidence`, `term-realised-gains`→`term-realised-pl`, adopting the **frontend/D-026-correct** spelling in each case); **(e)** the **17 non-glossary backend titles** are ruled to be **entry headings, not terms** — exempted from parity by an explicit allow-list carrying a reason per row, *never* by silence. *Rejected alternative: merge into one store. It sounds right and is wrong — it would either force a network request per popover hover, or ship the whole 550-line KB into the bundle.* **Owner rules (a)–(e).** **→ RULING: ✅ ACCEPTED (2026-07-19)** — served canonical for the page; bundled canonical for the popover (**offline, instant, no per-hover request**); **`GLOSSARY.md` the ENFORCED parent of both**. **Extend the two-store parity guard (page-heatmap §13-1 precedent) to cover `help.py`'s Terms store, so the 2-of-90 silent-alias drift becomes BUILD-BREAKING.** Merging the stores **stays rejected** for the reasons stated. |
| **9-3** | **Page structure + deep-link mechanism** | Template is **already settled** (Settings template, `DESIGN-SYSTEM.md:230`) and **search is already spec'd** (IA:85) — so only the deep-link half is genuinely open. Hash routing is in use, so an anchor competes with the route hash. | **Sectioned single page + `?q=` + `#`-fragment anchors.** Three `.lf-card` sections in served `categories` order (Pages · Terms · About), each entry anchored by its **served `id`** (`page-home`, `term-xirr-twr`) — the ids already exist and are unique (`test_help.py:11`). Under HashRouter the deep link is `#/help?q=…#term-xirr-twr`-shaped; **the page scrolls to the anchor in an effect keyed on the fragment**, rather than relying on browser-native anchor scrolling, which HashRouter does not deliver. Search state lives in `?q=` so a result is shareable. **No separate topic-index page** — 41 entries do not warrant one, and a second page would split the canonical home. |
| **9-4** | **Sidebar placement — now vs at R-39** | Help is **not visible** in the nav today, but its slot is **already ratified and coded** (`nav.ts:64`, System group, between Settings and Legal, per IA:109 / D-043). | **Flip `built: true` on `nav.ts:64`. That is the entire change** — no new entry, no reorder, no new group, no new component. **It cannot collide with R-39**, whose three ratified constraints (`ROADMAP.md:52`) are (a) semantic-only colour, (b) no avatar/account block, (c) collapse-to-icon rides the **existing D-078 sidebar-collapsed** setting — **none of which concerns which items are visible**. R-39 restyles the sidebar; it does not re-decide its contents. **Nothing here is re-done at R-39.** *(Note the flip also inverts a pinned test — §7, Phase 3.)* |
| **9-5 ⚑** | **Content authoring scope for v2.0.0** | 0-C: a large fraction of served content is v1-era and **wrong**. Shipping it would violate *"every claim in help copy must match ratified behaviour."* Eight built pages have **no** entry. **And 0-G puts a number on the rest: `GLOSSARY.md` marks 73 terms `[Help]`, `help.py` serves 29 — ≈44 promised entries do not exist.** Shipping all 44 is not a release-blocking milestone; shipping none leaves the spec's own promise unmet. This is the milestone's bulk and needs the owner's line. | **Three tiers. TIER 1 (release-blocking, MUST ship correct):** fix every stale `Pages` entry (Snapshot→Net worth, Planning→Cash flow + Scenarios, Investment policy→Policy, Pricing health→Pricing Health), the **D-026** "Realised gains" wording, the **D-046** "Simple/Expert" wording, and **delete the `✎` claim** (page-policy §13-2: the pencil never shipped). **TIER 2 (release-blocking):** author the **8 missing `Pages` entries** — Accounts · Heatmap · Review · Insurance · Estate · Scenarios · Cash flow · Legal — so no built page is undocumented. **TIER 3 (POST-RELEASE):** the **≈44 `[Help]`-marked terms with no catalogue entry** (0-G), plus enrichment of the existing 29. **Rationale:** Tiers 1–2 are *honesty* — the product must not describe itself **falsely**, and that is a release bar. Tier 3 is *completeness* — describing itself **partially** is honest, and completeness is not a release bar. **Mechanism so Tier 3 is not silently forgotten:** the parity guard (§9-2c) reports the `[Help]`-marked-but-unserved count as a **visible non-blocking number**, and the remainder is logged to `08-TECH-DEBT.md` — *no silent caps* (TEMPLATE). **Note also that some `[Help]` marks are PROPOSED, not RATIFIED** (`GLOSSARY.md:310`), so the 44 is an upper bound on what is genuinely owed. **Every shipped entry is reviewed against the page spec it describes**, and is PROPOSED until the Phase-7 walk. **Owner rules the tier split.** **→ RULING: ✅ ACCEPTED (2026-07-19)** — **Tier 1 + Tier 2 release-blocking** (fix every false entry; author the 8 missing pages); **Tier 3 (~44 terms) POST-RELEASE, filed as a ROADMAP row.** The governing principle is recorded **verbatim**: ***"describing itself falsely is a release bar; describing itself partially is not."*** |
| **9-6 ⚑** | **TONE / VOICE — the specimen to ratify** | SN-1 requires all copy ratified by the owner. A voice ratified *once, in-plan* is far cheaper than re-litigating every entry at the walk (**41 today, 49 after §9-5's Tier 2**). | **Ratify the voice from the three specimens in §11**, drafted in the product's existing honest-plain register (they are rewrites of real entries, not inventions). The proposed rules: **second person, present tense; state what the page/term IS and what it is FOR; name the honest limit plainly; never prescribe an action; never use a decision ID or an internal enum; no marketing register.** **Owner ratifies the voice specimen; every entry then conforms to it.** **→ RULING: ✅ CRITERION NOW, RATIFICATION AT 0a (2026-07-19)** — the three §11 specimens **must match the register of the product's already-ratified served strings** (*"headlines are retrieved, never invented"*; *"Carried forward — a price or exchange rate was unavailable on this date"*): **plain, honest, no marketing, no hedging.** **Any specimen drifting from that register FAILS the criterion.** **The owner ratifies voice BY LOOKING at the rendered 0a specimen, not as prose in a plan** — so §11 is a criterion to build against, not the ratification itself. |
| **9-7** | **Content-accuracy + advice-free guards** (0-B, §3a) | The advice guard covers **Terms only**; there is **no accuracy guard at all** — which is precisely how 0-C's stale content survived to release-blocking status. A spec edit regenerates no contract (§3b note), so nothing stops silent drift back. | **Two standing guards, each proven RED→GREEN:** **(a)** an **accuracy guard** asserting every `Pages` entry's title matches a `nav.ts` label exactly and references no redirect-only path — **seen RED on today's content** (it fails on 4+ entries now, which is the proof it works); **(b)** the **advice-free phrasing guard extended from `Terms` to ALL categories**. *A guard never seen to fire is not a guard* (page-markets §13a). |
| **9-8** | **The 22 dead popover entries** (0-D) | 22 of 63 popover entries render nowhere; the parity guard is one-way and cannot see them. Dead copy is a maintenance liability that reads as shipped. | **Do NOT delete them in this milestone** — several (`term-snapshot`, `term-backfill`, `term-intraday`, `term-interval`) are R-42/R-43 terms authored spec-first and awaiting their retrofit sites, and §9-1's target list will **consume some of them**. **Instead: (a)** run the reverse check and **record the surviving dead list in the close-out** after Phase 4 consumes what it consumes; **(b)** add a **non-blocking reverse-parity report** (not a failing test) so the count is visible rather than invisible; **(c)** log deletion of the true leftovers to `08-TECH-DEBT.md` as post-release. **Deleting terms mid-milestone would fight §9-1's ruling before it is made.** |
| **9-9** | **⚠ AI blast radius of the content pass** (0-F) | `app/ai/tools.py:145` grounds AI answers in this KB, pinned by `test_help.py`. Rewriting content **changes what the AI cites as fact** — and AI-surfaces (D-067/D-068) is the *next* milestone. | **Proceed, and declare it.** Correcting stale content **before** AI-surfaces is the right order — the AI must not be grounded in v1 page names, and doing it later means AI-surfaces inherits known-false facts. **Declare the touch explicitly in the Phase-1 commit + the close-out**, re-run the AI grounding tests in the same batch, and **note in `CURRENT.md` that AI-surfaces inherits a corrected KB.** *(Sequencing note: the AI-surfaces intake already carries a contention-fragile streaming test — unrelated, but the same milestone boundary.)* **→ RULING: ✅ ACCEPTED (2026-07-19)** — proceed; **the touch is declared.** **Record a cross-note into the AI-surfaces milestone intake: the help KB content is rewritten THIS milestone — AI-surfaces' grounding review must read the NEW content, never the v1-era entries.** |
| **9-10** | **Help category vocabulary vs MASTER-DATA** (§5) | The `Segmented` filter binds to `_CATEGORIES` (`help.py:516`), a served constant with **no MASTER-DATA entry** — nominally against CLAUDE.md's hard rule. | **Rule it a DISPLAY GROUPING, not a categorical data field** — it classifies authored content, is never stored, never user-set, and never filters user data. **Record the exemption explicitly in MASTER-DATA.md with its reason** (not by silence), and pin the three values with a served-value test. *Alternative: add a `/refdata` vocabulary — rejected as ceremony for a 3-value display axis.* **Owner confirms the exemption is recorded rather than assumed.** |
| **9-11** | **⚠ The "D-019 = verify-first" misattribution** | This plan's own SCOPE-NOTES header cited verify-first as **D-019**; `DECISIONS.md:209-215` shows D-019 is **"Merger recording in the transaction form"**. Verify-first is a `TEMPLATE-page-build.md` rule with **no decision ID**. A wrong ID propagates by copy-paste and makes a plan look spec-grounded where it is not. | **Corrected in this file's header.** **Grep `docs/` for other `D-019` citations and correct every one in the same commit** (the app-wide-label rule, page-chrome §11-4, applied to spec citations). *(This is the cheapest possible instance of page-heatmap §13-2 — "a spec claim must cite the spec FILE".)* **→ RULING: ✅ STANDS AS LOGGED (2026-07-19).** |
| **9-12** | **⚠ The `/help` contract shape is UNPINNED** (§3a, §3b) | The route is `-> dict`, so `API-CONTRACT.json:5909` records `{"type":"object","additionalProperties":true}`. The endpoint is in the frozen contract while its **shape is frozen not at all** — a field could vanish and the drift check would stay green. TEMPLATE §9 *"missing/ambiguous contract shape"*. | **Declare a `response_model` (Phase 0).** The triad (`what`/`why`/`improves`) must be **`Optional` and excluded-when-unset**, or the model will either strip it or force it onto non-Terms entries — the `HoldingView.price_display` trap. **Extend `test_help.py:73` to assert the WIRE response**, not only the service projection, and see it **RED** against a deliberately-stripping model first. *This is the one genuine contract delta; everything else about the endpoint is already real.* **→ RULING: ✅ STANDS AS LOGGED (2026-07-19) — §3b's reshape row PROCEEDS IN PHASE 0.** |
| **9-13** | **Component gap — prose, search results, category filter** (§4) | `DESIGN-SYSTEM.md` has **no** long-form/prose/topic-index/search-results component (grep: one hit, the GlossaryTerm row). Help is the product's only prose page. New components are **forbidden** without an amendment. | **Build from ratified primitives now; defer any extraction.** An entry is a title + body in `.lf-card__body`; the reading measure uses the **already-sanctioned** inner-MEASURE cap (`DESIGN-SYSTEM.md §3.1`), not a page-root `max-width`. Search results reuse the same card. **If the prose block or results list recurs, extract at its SECOND site** per the centralisation rule — not pre-emptively. **No Markdown renderer** (no templating precedent; would need an ADR). **Owner confirms this is composition, not an unratified component.** |
| **9-14** | **IA §5 has no Help ownership entry** (§2) | Help has a page-map row (`IA:85`) and a nav slot (`IA:109`) but **no per-page canonical-ownership subsection** — so §2 of this plan is **derived**, which the template forbids doing silently. Legal has the same gap. | **Add an IA §5 subsection for Help** carrying §2's table, whose substance is the one-line rule: **Help owns the knowledge base and nothing else; it describes what a page is FOR and what a term MEANS, and never restates a figure, a number, or a procedure another page owns.** Spec-first, before Phase 2. **Flag that Legal (the next milestone) has the identical gap**, so it is fixed there rather than rediscovered. |
| **9-T** | **GLOSSARY additions** | Under §9-2(c) the parity guard extends to the served store, and §9-1 may pick terms not yet in the spec. | **Spec-first, always** (page-heatmap §13-1): **no term is added to any popover or served store before `docs/specs/GLOSSARY.md`.** The exact additions **cannot be enumerated until §9-1 and §9-2 are ruled** — §10-B's candidates are drawn from terms **already in GLOSSARY.md** precisely so the common case needs **zero** additions. **Any addition §9-1 forces is listed and ratified before Phase 4**, never improvised at build time. |

**Sign-off to start build (2026-07-19):** **§3b's reshape row is APPROVED** · no open item blocks Phase 0
· the ⚑ rulings that gate Phase 0 (**9-2**, **9-5**) are **RULED**. **Phase 0 PROCEEDS**, backend-first,
**one delta per commit, fail-first, contract regen in the same commit with the path-key count stated.**

**⛔ HARD STOP AT THE 0a SPECIMEN** — rendered Help page + a live popover + the three voice specimens
visible, **walked pixel-by-pixel for the owner. Ratifications in chat only.** Phases beyond 0a
(nav flip, the §9-1 retrofit, the owner walk) do **not** begin until 0a is ratified.

**Zero on-page sites:** Portfolio · Instrument Detail · Net worth · Pricing Health · Holdings *(modal
only)* · all chrome.

### 10-B. §9-1 candidate targets — **PROPOSED, for the owner to confirm / trim / extend**

*Every candidate is a term **already present in `GLOSSARY.md`**, so the common case needs **no** §9-T
addition. Deliberately sparse — SN-1 **DECLINED blanket-tooltip-everything** (noise + unbounded copy
burden).*

| Page | Anchor (surface) | Proposed term | Already in `mocks/glossary.ts`? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Holdings** | table column header | **Unrealised P/L** | ✅ `term-unrealised-pl` *(currently dead — 0-D)* |
| **Holdings** | table column header | **Cost basis** | ✅ `term-cost-basis` *(currently dead)* |
| **Portfolio** | allocation card title | **Gross assets** | ✅ `term-gross-assets` *(KitchenSink only)* |
| **Portfolio** | stats card | **Concentration** | ✅ `term-concentration` |
| **Instrument Detail** | identity strip | **Data confidence** | ✅ `term-data-confidence` *(currently dead)* |
| **Net worth** | KPI strip | **Net worth** | ✅ `term-net-worth` |
| **Net worth** | trend card title | **Snapshot** | ✅ `term-snapshot` *(R-43, awaiting a site)* |
| **Net worth** | liquidity card | **Cash runway** | ✅ `term-cash-runway` *(KitchenSink only)* |
| **Pricing Health** | diagnostics column | **Data confidence** | ✅ `term-data-confidence` |
| **Chrome** | top-bar display toggle | **Density** | ✅ `term-density` |

**Note how this consumes four of 0-D's dead entries** — which is exactly why §9-8 proposes *not* deleting
them before this ruling lands.

## 11. §9-6 VOICE SPECIMENS — **PROPOSED, for the owner to ratify**

*Three rewrites of real entries — one per category — in the register the product already uses. Ratifying
these ratifies the voice for the whole catalogue (**41 entries today, 49 after Tier 2**); each conforms.*

**Specimen A — a `Pages` entry** *(rewrite of `page-snapshot`, corrected per 0-C):*

> **Net worth.** What you own minus what you owe, and how that has moved. The page shows the current
> figure, a trend built from dated snapshots, a breakdown by asset class, the liquidity ladder, and your
> cash runway. Dates with no price or exchange rate are carried forward and flagged, never filled in with
> a guess — so a gap in the trend is a gap you can see.

**Specimen B — a `Terms` entry** *(rewrite of `term-confidence`):*

> **Data confidence.** A 0–100 score for how well-sourced a holding's value is. It starts from the
> valuation method and subtracts for each honesty problem — a stale quote, a missing identifier mapping,
> a source that returned nothing. Every deduction is itemised, so the score is always explainable rather
> than a verdict. A low score means the figure is poorly grounded, not that the holding is a poor one.

**Specimen C — an `About` entry** *(the guarantee, tightened):*

> **What LedgerFrame will never do.** It never places a trade. It never tells you to buy, sell or hold,
> and it gives no tax or financial advice. It never invents a price, a headline or a figure — where data
> is unavailable you get "—" and the reason. The AI explains figures that were verified elsewhere; it
> does not produce them. Your data stays on your machine, and nothing is reported anywhere.

**The rules these specimens encode (proposed):** second person, present tense · say what it **is** and
what it is **for** · name the honest limit plainly, as a feature of the design rather than an apology ·
**never prescribe an action** · no decision IDs, no endpoint or enum names · no marketing register ·
every product term spelled exactly as GLOSSARY spells it.

## SCOPE-NOTES *(preserved verbatim — owner rulings recorded ahead of the draft; inputs to §9)*

### SN-1 — `[Help]` retrofit to the pre-affordance pages *(owner, 2026-07-14)*

**Retrofit `[Help]` to the pages built BEFORE the affordance existed — Holdings, Instrument Detail,
Portfolio, and the chrome.**

- **Targets are owner-picked, per page.** Which terms get a popover is a **judgment call the owner makes
  page by page** — not a rule automation applies.
- **Copy is PROPOSED → ratified at the walk.** Every popover body is drafted as PROPOSED and **ratified by
  the owner at the page walk**, like all user-facing copy.
- **Blanket-tooltip-everything is DECLINED.** Reason recorded: **noise + an unbounded copy burden**. A
  popover on every term trains the user to ignore all of them, and every one of them is a string somebody
  has to write, ratify, and keep true.

**Binding on the retrofit (from the existing rules, not new ones):**

- **A GLOSSARY term ships to the SPEC, not just the popover data** (page-heatmap §13-1). The glossary has
  **two stores** — `docs/specs/GLOSSARY.md` (canonical) and `frontend/src/mocks/glossary.ts` (what
  `[Help]` renders). **Add to `GLOSSARY.md` FIRST**, then the popover data.
  `tests/unit/test_glossary_parity.py` polices them: every popover term must exist in the spec with the
  **identical spelling**.
- Every retrofitted term must already exist in GLOSSARY with that exact spelling (CLAUDE.md hard rule), or
  its addition is a §9 item — **not an improvisation at build time**.

> **Verify-first note (2026-07-19):** SN-1's "**two stores**" is now known to be **three** — `help.py`'s
> served `Terms` entries are a third, unguarded store (0-E). SN-1 is not wrong; it is **incomplete**,
> because the third store was invisible until this pass read the engine. **§9-2 resolves it.**
