## 0. WHAT R-38 IS

A **provider routing matrix**: a **per asset-class × listing-country** mapping that
says *which provider prices this kind of instrument in this market*. Today routing
is resolved by a fixed lane policy (`DEFAULT_PRIORITY`) + the active provider + a
per-instrument `source_override`. R-38 adds a **user-editable mapping table** as one
new precedence layer, with a canonical editor in **Settings → Data feeds** (§14st-1)
and per-cell provenance surfaced (read-only) on **Pricing Health**.

The platform still **never fabricates a price** and **never advises**; this is a
routing-*configuration* surface, not a pricing change. It **inherits verbatim** the
router's standing guarantee: *the active market provider can never overwrite a NAV
or a canonical-id crypto price with a wrong equity quote*
(`05-PROVIDERS-AND-ROUTING.md:106-107`; `router.py:245-276` + `services/market.py`
`refresh_quote`).

**R-38 is NOT R-13.** D-072 parks *per-lane provider **priority** editing* as R-13
(*"no user-editable provider priority in v2 — visibility yes, editability no"*,
`ROADMAP.md:26`; `page-pricing-health.md:146`). R-38 is a **different shape** — a
cell *selects one provider* for a class×country; it does **not** reorder a lane's
priority chain. The editor lives in **Settings**, not Pricing Health (which stays
read-only, D-072). See §9 item R for the explicit reconciliation the owner must
ratify.

## 1. THE KEPT MACHINERY (verify-first, confirmed 2026-07-18)

Recorded so the milestone does not rebuild what exists. Each claim is grepped.

| Kept | Where (verified) |
|------|------------------|
| `CAPABILITIES` registry declares `asset_classes` + `regions` **per provider** | `router.py:53` (dict), dataclass `ProviderCapabilities` `:31-46` (`asset_classes: frozenset` `:44`, `regions: frozenset` — ISO-3166 alpha-2 or `"*"` `:45`) |
| The pure resolver `route()` takes `asset_class` / `asset_subclass` / `listing_country` and resolves against the policy | `router.py:195-287`; `lane_for(...)` `:128-149`; `DEFAULT_PRIORITY` `:112-125` |
| A **per-instrument `source_override`** precedence slot already exists and wins first | `router.py:236-241` (`if source_override in CAPABILITIES:`) |
| Edit-time override validation (the rejection precedent R-38 inherits) | `services/market.py` `validate_source_override` (returns `(None, error)` → the route turns it into a 400) |
| Live context gathering (what R-38's matrix lookup will extend) | `services/market.py` `route_for_instrument` — gathers `mappings`, `active_provider`, `has_manual`, `source_override`, `availability`, then calls `route()` |
| `capabilities_for(name)` lookup helper; `provider_availability()` | `router.py:93-95`; `services/market.py` |
| Alpha Vantage learned tier (`av_tier`), ETF-proxy fallback when not premium | `external.py:96-110` (`av_tier` `:108`, `_index_entitled` `:99`), `:104-105` (`supports_indices`), `:140`/`:152-153` (learns premium/free), `:44-45` (proxy comment) |

> The capability model a validated matrix needs — *"which providers cover which
> class×region"* — **already exists**. R-38 is the mapping layer + its editing + its
> provenance, **not** the capability engine.

## VERIFY-FIRST DELIVERABLE — THE CAPABILITY-COVERAGE TABLE

From the **actual registry** (`router.py:53-90`). This is the reality §9 is ruled
against — not memory. `fetch_on_demand=False` ⇒ rate-limited (serve cache, refresh
via worker/button, `:42`).

| Provider | asset_classes | regions | needs_key | entitlement | fetch_on_demand | Tier variance |
|----------|---------------|---------|:---------:|-------------|:---------------:|---------------|
| `mock` | all (`_ALL`) | `*` | – | delayed | ✓ | — |
| `csv` | equity, etf | `*` | – | end-of-day | ✓ | — |
| `yahoo` | all | `*` | – | delayed | ✗ | — |
| `alphavantage` | equity, etf, fx, crypto, **index** | US, `*` | ✓ | delayed | ✗ | **`av_tier` premium/free/unknown — `index` is premium-only; free keys fall back to ETF proxies** (`external.py:96-110`) |
| `amfi_nav` | mutual_fund | IN | – | end-of-day | ✗ | — (cache-publish; `amfi_code`) |
| `coingecko` | crypto | `*` | – | delayed | ✗ | — (cache-publish; `coingecko_id`) |
| `ecb_fx` | fx | `*` | – | end-of-day | ✗ | — (quote=False; FX fallback only) |
| `eodhd` | equity, etf, fx, crypto, index, mutual_fund | US, SG, IN, `*` | ✓ | delayed | ✗ | — |
| `kite` | equity, derivative, commodity | IN | ✓ | delayed | ✗ | — |

**`_ALL` = `{equity, etf, index, fx, crypto, commodity}`** (`router.py:52`).

### The CURRENT resolution chain, as implemented in `route()` — step by step

Read from `router.py:216-287` (do not assume — this is the code order):

0. **Compute lane + chain** (`:216-217`): `lane = lane_for(class, subclass, country)`
   (`:128-149`); `chain = DEFAULT_PRIORITY[lane]` (`:112-125`, falls back to
   `["manual"]`).
1. **`source_override`** (`:236-242`): if `source_override in CAPABILITIES` → **it
   wins**, `market_quote` (or `official_nav` for amfi_nav), returns. Unknown override
   → ignored, reason recorded, falls through.
2. **Manual-only lanes** (`:245-249`): `lane in _MANUAL_LANES` (`= {manual_only,
   deposit}`, `:156`) → `manual` if `has_manual` else `None`+"set a manual value".
   Returns. *A feed never prices these.*
3. **Cache-publish lanes** (`:255-276`): for `amfi_nav↔amfi_code` /
   `coingecko↔coingecko_id` (`_CACHE_PUBLISH`, `:154`) on `mutual_fund`/`crypto`:
   - mapped **and** `cached_source == src` → the cache-publish source **owns** it
     (`official_nav` / `market_quote`), returns (`:258-261`).
   - `mutual_fund` is **strict**: mapped-but-no-NAV → "awaiting NAV"; unmapped →
     `mapping_required`, manual/None. **Returns** (`:262-273`) — *never an equity
     feed for a fund.*
   - `crypto` unmapped → sets `mapping_required` then **breaks/falls through** to the
     active provider (`:274-276`). *Symbol pricing legitimately continues.*
4. **Active provider** (`:279-282`): if `active_provider in chain` **or** `== "mock"`
   → `market_quote`, returns.
5. **Else** (`:284-287`): `manual` if `has_manual` else `None`+"no configured source
   can price this holding".

`_finish` (`:224-232`) then computes the `_auth_gap` (`:161-175`) and sets
`auth_required` when a **higher-priority, configured, keyed** source is missing
credentials.

**The NAV/canonical-crypto guarantee lives in steps 2–3 returning before step 4.**
Any R-38 matrix cell MUST slot so that steps 1–3 still fire first — see §9 item 1.

---

## 2. IDENTITY

*R-38 is not a new page.* It is **three coordinated changes** to existing surfaces
(the page-chrome / first-run retrospectives: a plan may govern a cross-cutting
capability, not a single route). Identity per affected surface:

| Surface | What R-38 adds | Template / spec ref |
|---------|----------------|---------------------|
| **`route()` resolver** (backend) | one new precedence layer (the matrix cell) between override and active provider | `router.py`; `05-PROVIDERS-AND-ROUTING.md` §A.6 |
| **Settings → Data feeds** (`/settings?tab=data-feeds`) | the **matrix editor** (canonical home, §14st-1; `page-settings.md:696-704`) | Settings template; DESIGN-SYSTEM §3 |
| **Pricing Health** (`/pricing-health`) | per-instrument **provenance**: which provider priced this, via which rule (read-only, D-072) | Worklist template; `page-pricing-health.md` |

**One-line purpose:** let the owner declare *which provider prices each asset-class ×
listing-country*, validated against real capability, as a refinement layer that can
never silently repoint an instrument or overwrite a NAV.

---

## 3. OWNERSHIP TABLE

**Owns (canonical, authoritative):**
- **The routing matrix** (the class×country→provider mapping) — canonical editor home
  is **Settings → Data feeds** (P-1; `page-settings.md:702`). One home; Pricing Health
  *reads* provenance, never owns the matrix.
- **The routing *decision*** stays owned by `route()` (backend) — **served, never
  re-derived frontend** (D-105/P-1; `page-pricing-health.md:52`).

**Summarises (via the named reader, linked, never recomputed):**

| Summary shown | Canonical page | Shared reader reused | Link target |
|---------------|----------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Per-instrument "priced by X via rule Y" | Pricing Health (provenance/routing diagnostics, D-038) | `route()` via `route_for_instrument` (the SAME reader the page already serves) | Pricing Health row-detail |
| "Provider" / "Data provider" wording | Settings (D-028 split — Provider is a Settings-only concept) | `/system/data-source` served list | Settings → Data feeds |

**Enforcement corollary (P-1/D-031):** Pricing Health may only *display* the matrix
outcome that `route()` returns — it adds **no** new figure and **no** editing (D-072,
`page-pricing-health.md:146`, `:176`). The matrix editor adds **no** routing math to
the frontend — every validation/decision is served (D-105).

**Links to:** Pricing Health ⇄ Settings → Data feeds (the "correct-source" ⇄
"routing policy" pair).

## 4. API SURFACE

### 4a. Endpoints consumed (already in the frozen contract — 132 paths baseline)

| Method + path | Purpose on this milestone | Response shape pinned? |
|---------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| `GET /api/v1/refdata` | class/country/provider vocabularies (D-005 zero-copy) for the editor `MasterSelect`s; already serves `source_override` provider list from CAPABILITIES (`API-CONTRACT.md:69`) | ✓ `{value,label}` |
| `GET/PUT /api/v1/system/data-source` | active provider + write-only key (the *appliance default*, D-014/D-003; `system.py:113,158`; `page-settings.md:152`) — **the migration baseline for §9 item 4** | ✓ |
| `GET /api/v1/portfolio/pricing-health` | per-holding routing diagnostics (already serves `route_source`/`route_lane`/`priority_chain`; `page-pricing-health.md:67,130-131`) — R-38 **reshapes** it (§4b) | ✓ |
| `PATCH /api/v1/instruments/{symbol}` (`source_override`) | the existing per-instrument correction (validated; `page-pricing-health.md:70`) — unchanged, still wins over the matrix | ✓ |

### 4b. Contract deltas (needed but not in the baseline — BUILD BACKEND-FIRST)

Each row built backend-first; regenerate `API-CONTRACT.json` + `docs/openapi.json`
**same commit** (`make api-contract-check`). Served **display strings** throughout
(D-105/D-005). `response_model` must declare every served field or it is stripped
(the `price_display` lesson, TEMPLATE §3b).

| kind | Endpoint (current → intended) | Decision | Why this milestone needs it |
|------|-------------------------------|----------|-----------------------------|
| add | `GET /api/v1/system/routing-matrix` | R-38 | list all matrix cells (served class/country/provider labels + degraded flags) for the editor |
| add | `PUT /api/v1/system/routing-matrix` | R-38 | upsert one cell (class×country→provider); **edit-time validated** → honest **400** on a capability mismatch (the `validate_source_override` precedent), per §9 item 3 |
| add | `DELETE /api/v1/system/routing-matrix/{class}/{country}` | R-38 | clear a cell → falls back to lane/active (§9 item 2). Rename/removal tests discriminate by **shape**, not status (SPA serves 200 HTML) — TEMPLATE §3b |
| reshape | `GET /api/v1/portfolio/pricing-health` (+ `route_rule`) | R-38 / §9 item 10 | RouteDiagnostic gains a served `route_rule` (`override`/`matrix`/`lane`/`active`) — **one derivation** from `route()`, surfaced read-only |

**Guards audited (TEMPLATE §3b, page-news §13a):** the matrix CRUD is a **mutation**
→ `require_auth` (the `source_override` PATCH precedent, `page-pricing-health.md:70`).
No egress is added (routing config is local). Resolve-time re-validation is a
**behaviour** (invisible to a shape check) → pinned by a fail-first test (§9 item 3).

> **[CORRECTION 2026-07-18, ratified §12 (Flag 1).]** The three added operations
> above (`GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) land on **two** OpenAPI path-keys — `GET` and `PUT`
> share `/system/routing-matrix`, and `DELETE` owns
> `/system/routing-matrix/{asset_class}/{listing_country}`. So the binding contract
> count is **132 → 134 path-keys**, not the "+3 / 135" this §4b prose originally
> implied (which counted operations). The ruled endpoint SHAPES shipped verbatim;
> 134 is the observed path-key count — resolved by evidence.

---

## 5. NEW DATA MODEL (the missing scope — mapping table)

*Home: `02-DATA-MODEL.md`; migration posture: ADR-0001 (keep the legacy Alembic
chain; new tables are additive migrations on head). Current single head =
`b3e2f1a9c740` (`institution_fk`).*

A new persisted model, mirroring the existing cache/master table pattern
(`amfi_schemes` `02-DATA-MODEL.md:152`, `coingecko_coins` `:163`):

- **`routing_matrix`** — columns (PROPOSED, ratify at build): `id` PK · `asset_class`
  (String, `AssetClass` vocab) · `listing_country` (String — ISO-3166 alpha-2 **or**
  `"*"`, mirroring `CAPABILITIES.regions`) · `provider` (String, a CAPABILITIES name)
  · `updated_at`. **Unique** on `(asset_class, listing_country)` — one provider per
  cell.
- **Migration:** additive `create_table` on head `b3e2f1a9c740`, with a full
  `downgrade()` (the `f9e1a2b3c4d5` drop-migration precedent, data-guarded), per
  ADR-0001.
- **Default content:** **empty** (§9 item 4/2) — an empty matrix changes *nothing*
  (falls through to today's lane/active behaviour). This honours the PARAM-WINS
  honesty precedent (Amendment A): *the defaults must not silently repoint any
  instrument's current provider.*

---

## 6. COMPONENTS

*Ratified `src/components/ui/` only. Any affordance the inventory lacks → a §5
DESIGN-SYSTEM amendment raised at Phase 0a (the Pricing-Health route-chain / Holdings
lessons). No new component without an amendment.*

| Ratified component | Role | Data source | Prop/state not exercised at kitchen-sink |
|--------------------|------|-------------|------------------------------------------|
| `DataTable` | the matrix grid (rows = class×country cells; columns = provider + degraded state) | `GET /system/routing-matrix` (real) | editable-cell rows (see amendment flag) |
| `MasterSelect` | per-cell provider picker — **capability-filtered served options** (D-005) | `/refdata` provider list (real) | option subset filtered by class×country |
| `StatusChip` / `StalenessChip` | honest degraded-cell state (needs-key / tier-degraded / incapable) | served display strings | degraded-cell tone |
| `ConfirmDialog (+PIN?)` | gate for a matrix write (`require_auth`) | — | auth-gated config write |
| `MetaStrip` | (Pricing Health) the read-only per-instrument route rule/lane/source | served `route_rule`/`route_lane`/`route_source` | already used for the route chain (`page-pricing-health.md:98`) |

**Affordances the inventory may lack (amendment gate — see §9 item 9):**
- An **editable-cell grid** (a `DataTable` whose cells host a `MasterSelect`) is not
  in the ratified inventory as a pattern. If the build can compose it from
  `DataTable` + `MasterSelect` (a cell renderer), **no amendment**; if it needs a new
  affordance, it is a **§5 amendment raised at Phase 0a**, exactly like Pricing
  Health's route-chain affordance (`page-pricing-health.md:104-106`).

**Usage rules honoured:** served vocab zero-copy (D-005); popovers portal to viewport
(the `MasterSelect` dropdown); no decision IDs in user copy (copy hygiene, §11-8);
label changes are app-wide (§11-4).

**Tables (D-094):** the matrix is **bounded** (≤ `AssetClass` (13) × declared regions
— tens of cells) → **client-side** sort/filter is acceptable; record the assumption.
Pricing Health's diagnostics table keeps its existing server-side posture.

---

## 7. VOCABULARIES

*Source: MASTER-DATA.md + the router registry. Every categorical is a served
display string (D-005) — never hardcode a provider/class/country label.*

| Field | Vocabulary / master | Fixed (/refdata) or extensible | Ref |
|-------|---------------------|-------------------------------|-----|
| Matrix row **asset_class** | `AssetClass` (13: equity, etf, mutual_fund, bond, cash, fixed_deposit, commodity, crypto, property, private, retirement, liability, other) | Fixed (`/refdata`, D-005) | `MASTER-DATA.md:56` (D-010) |
| Matrix row **listing_country** | ISO-3166 **alpha-2 + `"*"` wildcard** — mirroring `CAPABILITIES.regions` | Fixed (the router's own region vocab; **NOT** the D-083 six-bucket model — §9 item 5) | `router.py:45`; `MASTER-DATA.md` §4 / D-083 |
| Matrix cell **provider** | CAPABILITIES provider names (served, the `source_override` list already does this) | Fixed (`/refdata`, D-005) | `router.py:53`; `API-CONTRACT.md:69` |
| Provenance **route rule** | `override` / `matrix` / `lane` / `active` (served labels) | Fixed (served) | §9 item 10 |

**Terminology (GLOSSARY parity — spec-first, page-heatmap §13-1):** the D-028 split
already defines **Provider** (Settings-only), **Source** (user-facing provenance),
**Routing/route** (internal + Pricing Health only) — `GLOSSARY.md:98-106,312-313`.
Any **new** user-facing term R-38 introduces (e.g. *"Routing matrix"* if shown as a
label) is authored **in `GLOSSARY.md` first**, then the popover data, guarded by
`test_glossary_parity.py` — see §9 item T. *"Data feeds"* is a plain tab label with
no entry (the §14st-1/§9-4 logic, `page-settings.md:709`).

---

## 8. DECISIONS IN FORCE

| Decision | What it forbids / requires here |
|----------|----------------------------------|
| **NAV/canonical guarantee** (`05` §A.6, `router.py:245-276`) | the matrix MUST slot **after** steps 2–3 (manual-only, cache-publish) so it can **never** overwrite a NAV or a mapped-and-published canonical crypto price — inherited verbatim (§9 item 1). |
| **D-072** (`page-pricing-health.md:146`) | routing chain is **visible, never editable** on Pricing Health; the matrix editor lives in **Settings**; **no provider-priority (lane-order) editing** — R-13 stays parked (§9 item R). |
| **PARAM-WINS honesty / Amendment A** | the default (empty) matrix must **not silently repoint** any instrument's current provider (§9 item 2/4). |
| **D-005 / D-105 / P-1** | matrix vocabularies + the routing decision are **served**, zero frontend copy, zero frontend routing math; one canonical home. |
| **D-014 / D-003** (`page-settings.md:49`) | the active provider + write-only key are the **appliance default** (env-backed via `/system/data-source`); §9 item 4 rules the matrix's relation to it. |
| **API-CONTRACT freeze** | matrix endpoints ship backend-first, contract regenerated same commit; `route_rule` added to the typed model AND regenerated. |
| **ADR-0001** | the new table is an **additive migration on the kept legacy chain**, with a full downgrade. |
| **D-028** (`GLOSSARY.md:98`) | Provider stays a Settings-only word; Pricing Health shows **Source/Routing**, not "Provider". |

---

## 9. NEEDS DECISION — §9 items (PROPOSED resolutions; ⚑ = genuine owner call)

*Do not build on any open item. Resolutions below are PROPOSED; the §9 one-pass with
the owner ratifies each. Ruled strictly against the coverage table + the verified
`route()` chain above, never memory.*

| # | Item | Why it blocks / what's needed | PROPOSED resolution (owner to approve) |
|---|------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **1 ⚑** | **The precedence slot** | Exactly where the matrix cell sits in the verified `route()` chain. | **Insert a new step "3.5" immediately before the active-provider fallback (`router.py:279`), after override (step 1), manual-only (step 2), and cache-publish/NAV (step 3) have returned.** The matrix cell then *replaces* `active_provider` as the market-provider consulted at step 4, for market lanes only. This inherits the NAV/canonical guarantee **verbatim** (steps 2–3 already returned) and matches the stub's "between override and active provider." Encoded fail-first in `route()` with pinned tests. |
| **2 ⚑** | **Unmapped-cell semantics** | A class×country with no matrix cell: refine, or declare "unrouted"? | **Fall through to the current lane chain / active provider (matrix as a *refinement*, not a gate).** An empty/absent cell = today's behaviour exactly → honours PARAM-WINS (no silent repoint). Pricing Health shows `route_rule = lane`/`active` for these. *Reject* explicit "unrouted" as the default — it would repoint instruments to `None` and break the guarantee. (Owner may opt into an explicit-unrouted mode per-cell later; not the default.) |
| **3** | **Capability validation, edit- AND resolve-time** | A cell may name only a provider whose CAPABILITIES cover that class×country. | **Edit-time:** `PUT` re-uses the `validate_source_override` logic (`services/market.py`) — `caps.asset_classes ∋ class` (or `*`) **AND** `caps.regions ∋ country` (or `*`), else an **honest 400** with the reason ("`{prov}` can't price a `{class}`" / "doesn't cover `{country}`"). **Resolve-time:** `route()` **re-validates** the cell against live CAPABILITIES (defence in depth, the `source_override` unknown-source precedent `:237`) — an incapable/stale cell is **ignored**, falls through to lane/active. Both pinned fail-first. |
| **4 ⚑** | **Migration of the single-provider config** | Does the active provider become the matrix default row, or stay a separate fallback layer? | **Stay a separate fallback layer (option B).** The active provider is an **appliance/env** setting (D-014), not per-cell data; keeping it as the terminal fallback means an **empty matrix changes nothing** (PARAM-WINS). `/system/data-source` **and** the Settings Data-feeds provider control are **unchanged** — the matrix is purely additive above them. *(Alternative A — active provider = the `*×*` default cell — would migrate an env setting into the DB and is rejected unless the owner wants a single control.)* |
| **5** | **Matrix dimensions** | Which country vocabulary is canonical for rows? | **asset_class × listing_country, country = ISO-3166 alpha-2 + `"*"` wildcard**, mirroring `CAPABILITIES.regions` (`router.py:45`) — the vocabulary `route()` actually resolves against. **NOT** the D-083 six-bucket region model (that is a *display* taxonomy; the resolver uses alpha-2). Resolves the stub's "country vocabulary" NEEDS-DECISION. Subclass granularity is **out** (class×country only) unless the owner widens it. |
| **6 ⚑** | **Lane scope** | Which lanes does the matrix govern? | **Quotes lane only.** `fx` routing (`services/fx.py`, a different consumer) and `news` feeds (`news.py` `/news/feeds`) are **explicit non-scope** — recorded here, not built — unless the owner widens R-38. |
| **7 ⚑** | **Keyed provider in a cell, no key set** | A cell names a `needs_key` provider with no credentials. | **Accept-with-caveat → honest degraded cell, never a silent dead cell.** Unlike `source_override` (an immediate correction that 400s on missing creds), the matrix is *forward-looking policy* — keys and policy are set independently. Edit-time **accepts** a *capable-but-unkeyed* provider but the cell shows a **degraded chip** ("needs credentials — add them in Settings"); resolve-time's `_auth_gap` (`:161-175`) already flags `auth_required` and the cell falls through until the key lands. *(Capability mismatch — item 3 — is still a hard 400; only the credentials case is accept-with-caveat.)* |
| **8 ⚑** | **Tier-dependent capabilities** (owner-raised 2026-07-18) | A provider's effective coverage varies by key tier (`av_tier`: `index` premium-only; ETF proxies when free). How does validation treat tier-unknown, resolve-time use the learned tier, and Pricing Health label a tier-degraded cell? | **Grounded strictly in `external.py:96-157`.** (a) **Scope note:** `av_tier` varies **`index` only** (`_AV_INDEX_SYMBOLS`); `index` is **not a holdings quote-lane** (`DEFAULT_PRIORITY` has no index lane), so within R-38's quotes-lane scope the tier variance is **narrow** — it bites the Markets/Global surface, not holding routing. (b) **Edit-time:** validate against **declared** CAPABILITIES (`alphavantage` declares `index`, `:67`); `av_tier` is **learned at runtime, not persisted** (`:99`), so edit-time **accepts with caveat** (block would be dishonest — the tier is genuinely unknown until the first probe). (c) **Resolve-time:** honours the **learned** `av_tier` via the **existing** ETF-proxy fallback (`:104-105`, `:149-157`) — **no new tier semantics invented**. (d) **Pricing Health:** a tier-degraded cell shows a **served honest string** (e.g. *"index via ETF proxy — key not premium"*), never a fabricated real-index label. |
| **9** | **The editor UI** | Ratified components only; an editable-cell grid may be a new pattern. | **Compose `DataTable` + `MasterSelect` (cell renderer) + `StatusChip`** — all ratified. If the editable-cell-grid composes cleanly, **no amendment**; if it needs a new affordance, it is a **§5 amendment raised at Phase 0a** (the route-chain precedent). Anything beyond the inventory is surfaced there, never improvised mid-build. |

## ROADMAP RIDER (recorded, not built)

**R-40 — Alpha Vantage premium feed expansion** (owner-raised 2026-07-18). Premium-tier
feeds beyond the current lanes (e.g. fundamentals / additional series) MAY serve future
platform needs. **DEFINITION OWED by the owner** — *which* feeds, serving *which* page,
before any plan. Input material: the owner-held vendor documentation (**not** a plan
source — the plan cites adapter code, never vendor PDFs). **Not R-38 scope:** R-38 routes
existing lanes only. → to be added as a dated `ROADMAP.md` entry at the §9 one-pass.

---

## BUILD PHASES (after §9 one-pass — NOT started)

- **Phase 0 — Contract + model deltas (§4b/§5):** the `routing_matrix` migration
  (ADR-0001, on head `b3e2f1a9c740`) + CRUD endpoints + `route_rule`, backend-first,
  contract regen same commit, `make api-contract-check` green. The precedence slot
  (§9 item 1) + edit/resolve validation (item 3) land here, **fail-first**.
- **Phase 0a — component confirm / amendment (§6/§9 item 9):** confirm the
  editable-cell grid composes from ratified components, or raise the §5 amendment.
- **Phase 1 — assembly:** the Settings → Data feeds editor + Pricing Health
  provenance column; honest degraded/needs-key/tier states.
- **Phase 2 — tests:** validation (edit + resolve), the NAV/canonical guarantee
  regression, provenance reconciliation, overflow suite extended.
- **Phase 3a — scripted pre-pass** (green before the walk) → **Phase 3b — owner
  walk** (judgment only) → **close ritual** (record + push).

**Sign-off to start build:** §9 has no open blocker · §4b deltas approved · no §6
component needs an unresolved amendment.

---

## §9 — RESOLVED (owner one-pass, 2026-07-18)

*The §9 one-pass happened in chat with the owner on 2026-07-18; the owner ruled every
item. The rulings below are binding and supersede the PROPOSED resolutions in the §9
table above (which stands as the reasoning of record). Build proceeds from these.*

- **1 — ACCEPT + AMENDMENT A (PREPEND SEMANTICS, binding).** The matrix cell is
  consulted at step **"3.5"**, immediately before the active-provider fallback
  (`router.py:279`), after override (step 1), manual-only (step 2), and
  cache-publish/NAV (step 3) have returned. **On failure or degradation — rate-limit,
  unkeyed, tier-degraded, error — resolution CONTINUES down the existing step-4 chain
  unchanged**: a cell can never price *less* than today. `route_rule = matrix` is
  served **only when the cell actually priced the instrument**. Items 1 and 7 are now
  consistent by construction. Encoded fail-first in `route()`; the load-bearing test is
  1(b) below.
- **2 — ACCEPT.** An unmapped cell **falls through** to the current lane chain / active
  provider (matrix as a *refinement*, not a gate). An **empty matrix = today's
  behaviour exactly**. Explicit "unrouted" is **rejected as the default** (it would
  repoint instruments to `None` and break the guarantee).
- **3 — ACCEPT.** **Edit-time** honest **400** via the `validate_source_override` logic
  (`caps.asset_classes ∋ class` or `*` **AND** `caps.regions ∋ country` or `*`).
  **Resolve-time** re-validates the cell against live CAPABILITIES; an incapable/stale
  cell is **ignored** → falls through. Both pinned fail-first.
- **4 — ACCEPT (option B).** The active provider stays a **separate env-rooted terminal
  fallback** (D-014). `/system/data-source` **and** the Settings provider control are
  **UNCHANGED**; the matrix is **purely additive** above them. (Alternative A — active
  provider as the `*×*` default cell — rejected: it migrates an env setting into the DB.)
- **5 — ACCEPT.** Dimensions = **asset_class × listing_country**; country =
  **ISO-3166 alpha-2 + `"*"` wildcard**, mirroring `CAPABILITIES.regions`. The D-083
  six-bucket region model is **display-only** and NOT used here. Subclass granularity is
  **out of scope**.
- **6 — ACCEPT.** **Quotes lane ONLY.** `fx` routing (`services/fx.py`) and `news` feeds
  (`/news/feeds`) are **explicit non-scope** — recorded, not built, untouched.
- **7 — ACCEPT.** A **capable-but-unkeyed** cell: **accept-with-caveat** → a degraded
  chip ("needs credentials — add them in Settings"); resolve-time `_auth_gap`
  fall-through until the key lands. (Capability *mismatch* — item 3 — remains a hard
  400; only the credentials case is accept-with-caveat.)
- **8 — ACCEPT.** Tier handling **grounded strictly in `external.py:96-157`.**
  Edit-time validates **declared** CAPABILITIES (`av_tier` is learned-not-persisted →
  accept-with-caveat); resolve-time honours the **learned** `av_tier` via the
  **existing** ETF-proxy fallback; Pricing Health serves the **honest string**
  ("index via ETF proxy — key not premium"). **No new tier semantics invented.**
- **9 — ACCEPT.** The editor **composes `DataTable` + `MasterSelect` + `StatusChip`**.
  If the editable-cell grid doesn't compose cleanly, a **§5 DESIGN-SYSTEM amendment is
  raised at Phase 0a** — never improvised mid-build.
- **10 — ACCEPT.** `route()` serves `route_rule`
  (`override` / `matrix` / `lane` / `active`) — **one derivation**; Pricing Health is
  **read-only** (D-072 intact).
- **11 — ACCEPT.** `GET`/`PUT` `/system/routing-matrix`,
  `DELETE /system/routing-matrix/{class}/{country}`; `route_rule` on
  `/portfolio/pricing-health`; `require_auth` on writes; D-105 served strings; contract
  baseline **132 → +3 operations** (GET, PUT, DELETE); shape-discriminated removal tests.
  *(Build note, 2026-07-18 execution: those three operations land on **two** OpenAPI
  path-keys — GET+PUT share `/system/routing-matrix` — so the path-key count is
  **132 → 134**; the "+3 / 135" figure in §4b/§11 counted operations, not path-keys.
  The ruled endpoint SHAPES above are the binding artifact; the count is reported as
  the observed 134. Owner ratifies the shapes by looking at 0a.)*
- **R — AFFIRMED.** R-38 (a cell selects **one provider**) is a **different shape** from
  R-13 (lane-priority reordering — **STAYS PARKED**). D-072's Pricing-Health-read-only
  prohibition is **INTACT**. Recorded cross-file in COMMIT 2.
- **T — ACCEPT.** **"Routing matrix"** = a GLOSSARY entry, authored **spec-first**
  (`GLOSSARY.md` THEN `mocks/glossary.ts`, parity guard). `route_rule` values are served
  **plain labels** (no glossary entries). "Data feeds" stays a plain tab label.

---

**Plan-only above §9-RESOLVED.** From §9-RESOLVED onward the owner has ruled; build
proceeds backend-first, fail-first, one delta per commit, STOP at Phase 0a for
ratification-by-looking.

---

## PHASE 0 + 0a — EXECUTION RECORD (2026-07-18)

Environment healthy at start: pytest collects 891; contract 132 paths & drift-check
green; single alembic head `b3e2f1a9c740`; frontend `npm run check` exit 0. Each delta
fail-first (RED on the real cause) → GREEN, one per commit.

- **DONE — §9-RESOLVED record** (`a3aa541`) — 13 rulings recorded verbatim-in-substance.
- **DONE — cross-record edits** (`27dbb3c`) — D-072 dated annotation (STANDS); ROADMAP
  R-40 lands; R-13 affirmed parked; GLOSSARY "Routing matrix" (spec-first) + popover;
  parity guard green (59).
- **DONE — Phase 0.1 migration** (`59258eb`) — `RoutingMatrix` model + additive
  migration `c1d4e7a90f38` on head `b3e2f1a9c740`, full downgrade; up→down→up verified;
  single head. 3 tests.
- **DONE — Phase 0.2 CRUD** (`48f35cd`) — GET/PUT/DELETE `/system/routing-matrix`;
  `validate_matrix_provider` (unknown 400 · class/region mismatch honest 400 · unkeyed
  accept-with-caveat §9-7). Contract regen same commit → **134 path-keys** (see note).
  12 tests.
- **DONE — Phase 0.3 slot 3.5** (`fa9af88`) — the AMENDMENT-A PREPEND in `route()`;
  `route_rule` on `RouteDiagnostic`. Pins (a)-(e) incl. the load-bearing (b) unkeyed
  fall-through and (e) NAV/canonical guarantee. 7 pure-route tests.
- **DONE — Phase 0.4 provenance** (`d31e08e`) — `route_rule` served on
  `/portfolio/pricing-health`; `av_tier_note` honest string (§9-8, grounded in
  `external.py`), served as `provider_tier_note`. 4 tests.
- **DONE — Phase 0a specimen** (`bb420de`) — `/kitchen-sink` "Routing matrix — SPECIMEN".
  **§9-9 finding: the editable-cell grid COMPOSES from `DataTable`+`MasterSelect`+
  `StatusChip`+`Button` — NO §5 amendment.** All five honesty cases + the Pricing Health
  provenance column (four `route_rule` values) staged.

**Suite after Phase 0:** 915 backend tests pass (0 fail); `make api-contract-check`
green; frontend `npm run check` **exit 0** (lint+typecheck+tokens+tests+overflow, 334).

**TWO ITEMS FLAGGED FOR OWNER RATIFICATION AT 0a (built as ruled; these are the two
judgment calls surfaced honestly rather than silently decided):**
1. **Contract count.** The ruled shapes (GET/PUT share `/system/routing-matrix`; DELETE
   on `/{class}/{country}`) = **132 → 134 path-keys** (+3 operations across 2 keys). The
   plan prose's "+3 / 135" counted operations, not path-keys. The SHAPES are the binding
   artifact; 134 is the observed count.
2. **Resolve-time matrix gate = capability, not chain-membership.** `route()` prices a
   cell when its provider is live-capable for THIS instrument (class+region per live
   CAPABILITIES) AND keyed — NOT gated on lane-chain membership. Rationale: the matrix is
   the authority that *selects* the provider, the edit-time 400 already blocks incapable
   cells, and Amendment A enumerates the fall-through reasons (rate-limit/unkeyed/tier/
   error) — chain-membership is not among them. Ratify or amend.

**STATUS: STOPPED at Phase 0a for owner ratification-by-looking.** NEXT (owner-gated):
Phase 1 assembly (the real Settings → Data feeds editor + Pricing Health provenance
column) — BLOCKED until the owner ratifies the specimen and the two flagged items.

---

## §12 — PHASE 0a RATIFICATION RECORD (owner, 2026-07-18)

The Phase 0a specimen (`bb420de`) was **RATIFIED BY THE OWNER on 2026-07-18** by
looking. Both flagged items were ruled. Phase 0a is closed; Phase 1 assembly is
unblocked and proceeds from these rulings.

- **SPECIMEN RATIFIED.** The editor grid composes from ratified components
  (`DataTable` + a `MasterSelect` cell renderer + `StatusChip` + a `Clear`
  `Button`) — **NO §5 DESIGN-SYSTEM amendment** is raised. All five honesty frames
  (healthy mapped cell §9-1; unkeyed degraded caveat §9-7; tier-degraded served
  string §9-8; capability-mismatch honest 400 §9-3; empty matrix = today §9-2)
  are **accepted as staged**, plus the Pricing Health provenance column (all four
  `route_rule` values, read-only §9-10).

- **FLAG 1 — RATIFIED. Contract count = 134 path-keys.** `GET` + `PUT` share the
  `/system/routing-matrix` path-key; the three ruled OPERATIONS land on **two**
  OpenAPI path-keys (`/system/routing-matrix` and
  `/system/routing-matrix/{asset_class}/{listing_country}`). The ruled endpoint
  **SHAPES** shipped verbatim; **134** is the observed binding path-key count. The
  "+3 / 135" in the §4b/§11 planning prose was a counting slip (operations, not
  path-keys) — see the dated correction notes in-place there. *Resolved by
  evidence, 2026-07-18.*

- **FLAG 2 — AFFIRMED. The resolve-time matrix gate is CAPABILITY (live-capable +
  keyed), NOT chain-membership.** A cell may name a capable, keyed provider that
  is **outside** the lane's fallback chain and it will price the instrument. The
  edit-time 400 already blocks incapable cells; Amendment A's fall-through reasons
  (rate-limit / unkeyed / tier-degraded / error) are **exhaustive** and
  chain-membership is **deliberately not among them** — the matrix is the
  authority that *selects* the provider (recorded verbatim against §9-1 / §9-3).

**Build from here (owner-gated, this session):** Phase 1 assembly · Phase 2 tests ·
Phase 3a scripted pre-pass → STOP. Phase 3b is the owner walk (separate session,
no self-certification).

---

## §13 — PHASE 1–3a EXECUTION RECORD (2026-07-18)

Built from the ratified rulings, backend-first where relevant, small commits.

- **DONE — Commit 1: §12 ratification record** (`af66bd7`) — specimen ratified;
  Flag 1 (134 path-keys) + Flag 2 (capability-not-chain gate) recorded; dated
  strike-and-annotate corrections added in-place to §4b/§11.
- **DONE — Phase 1 assembly** (`a597cf3`) — **Settings → Data feeds: the Routing
  matrix card** below Market data + News feeds. Composes `DataTable` +
  `MasterSelect` (cell) + `StatusChip` + `Button` (§9-9, no §5 amendment).
  Add-rule flow (class + market + provider) **capability-validated by the honest
  edit-time 400, rendered verbatim** in a `role="alert"` (§9-3); per-cell provider
  edit + Clear (DELETE → fall-through); the degraded **caveat chip** shows the
  served string, the Provider API key control is in the same tab above (§9-7);
  the ratified **empty-state verbatim** (§9-2); the "Routing matrix" `[Help]`
  popover serves the GLOSSARY entry. Market vocab = the router's ISO alpha-2
  regions + `"*"` (§9-5), served from `/system/providers`. **Pricing Health:** the
  read-only **`route_rule` provenance column** (override/matrix/lane/active,
  neutral chips), the route-detail **MetaStrip** (Source · Rule · Lane · Class ·
  Native price), and the **`av_tier_note`** honest string where served (§9-8/§9-10,
  D-072 — no edit affordance). New reader `api/routing-matrix.ts`.
- **DONE — Phase 2 tests** (`936a720`) — **frontend** component tests: empty-state
  verbatim; Active + degraded caveat chips; the edit-time 400 rendered verbatim;
  add PUT + reload; Clear DELETE; per-cell edit PUT; the provenance column (all
  four values), the MetaStrip Rule, the tier-note. **backend** pins: the **Flag-2**
  pin (capable+keyed OFF-chain cell prices via matrix) + its unkeyed counter-pin;
  the matrix CRUD **require_auth** (locked → PUT/DELETE 401).
- **DONE — Phase 3a demo-seed** (`566d7ac`) — two matrix cells seeded in
  `seed_demo_data` (the ONE function both boot paths call — seed parity): `(etf,
  US → mock)` so the demo VOO **prices via the matrix end-to-end**
  (`route_rule=matrix`), and `(equity, IN → eodhd)` unkeyed → the degraded caveat
  path. Seed-parity pin asserts both cells + VOO priced-by-matrix. *Root-cause
  note: an earlier `(etf, US → yahoo)` seed decided `matrix` but left the US ETFs
  unpriced in the offline demo (yahoo can't quote here) — it broke the
  performance/markets fact tests; the honest end-to-end demo needs the provider
  that can actually quote here, which is `mock`.*

### Phase 3a scripted pre-pass — RESULT (isolated demo instance, owner instance untouched)

The pre-pass ran against an **isolated dev stack** (own temp data dir, backend on
spare port 8399, Vite dev on 5199) so the owner's live stack (5173 → 8321 →
`~/.ledgerframe-data`) was **never touched** — the restore path is that nothing of
the owner's was mutated (Settings §15 lesson (c)).

- **Smoke sweep — 0 console errors:** Settings ×6 tabs × light/dark × 320/375/900/
  1366 + Pricing Health at every width. (The one console entry in the whole run is
  the **intentional** kite→US `400` triggered in the capture phase to screenshot
  the honest reason — an expected rejection, not a defect.)
- **Matrix-priced holding end-to-end:** demo VOO → `route_rule=matrix`,
  `source=mock`, status Delayed, real value — visible on Pricing Health.
- **Degraded caveat live:** `(equity, IN → eodhd)` stored + shown degraded with the
  served caveat; routing falls through.
- **Screenshots captured:** editor with rules; the edit-time `400` ("kite doesn't
  cover US"); Pricing Health provenance (all four `route_rule` values incl. an
  override set live); the route-detail MetaStrip (VOO, rule=matrix); the empty
  state (both rules cleared → fall-through). The unkeyed **caveat chip** is in the
  editor grid within the editor screenshot.

**Gates:** backend **920 passed**; `make api-contract-check` green; contract
**134 path-keys** (Flag 1); frontend `npm run check` **exit 0** (lint+typecheck+
tokens+tests+overflow, 334, incl. the taller Data feeds tab).

**STATUS: STOPPED after Phase 3a.** NEXT: **Phase 3b — the owner walk** (separate
session, judgment only, no self-certification), then the close ritual.

---

## §14 — PHASE 3b OWNER WALK — FINDINGS (2026-07-18)

The owner walked the live Data feeds tab. **Two findings filed** (this docs commit),
then fixed verify-first (fail-first RED on the real cause, no mutating smokes against
the owner's live instance — an isolated demo stack only).

### §14dr-1 — BUG (P1): provider API-key save fails; toast renders "[object Object]"

**Reproduce:** Data feeds tab → switch Market data provider to `alphavantage` → paste
a key → **Save key**. Toast: *"Couldn't save key: [object Object]"*. The key is NOT
saved.

**Real cause (layer 1 — verified, not guessed).** RED capture against an isolated
stack: `PUT /api/v1/system/data-source` with the Save-key body `{"api_key": "…"}`
returns **HTTP 422**, body:
`{"detail":[{"type":"missing","loc":["body","provider"],"msg":"Field required","input":{"api_key":"…"}}]}`.
The `DataSourceIn` model (`app/api/v1/routes/system.py:151-156`) declares
`provider: str` **required**, while `api_key` / `base_currency` / `stale_after_seconds`
are all optional partial-update fields. The Save-key control posts **only**
`{api_key}` (`frontend/src/routes/Settings.tsx:475-476` → `putDataSource({ api_key })`),
and the reader's own type already declares `provider?` optional
(`frontend/src/api/systemConfig.ts:27`). So the key-save 422s **every time**,
independent of the provider switch — `provider` being required is the contract
anomaly. This is NOT a legitimate rejection: the user's intent (store a key for the
active provider) is valid; the endpoint wrongly demands a field the partial-update
caller has no reason to send.
- **Fix level: BACKEND (the standard).** Make `DataSourceIn.provider` optional and
  only write `LEDGERFRAME_MARKET_PROVIDER` when present — aligning it with the three
  fields that are already optional and with the reader contract. Contract regen
  same-commit (`provider` moves required→optional in the OpenAPI body schema). Note
  string made conditional (no `"now using 'None'"`).

**Error surface (layer 2 — SYSTEMIC, verified).** `client.ts:21` does
`detail = String(body.detail)`. A FastAPI 422 `detail` is an **array of objects**, so
`String([{…}])` → `"[object Object]"`. Every reader feeds the toast/`role=alert`
through this one choke point (`error: r.error`, all of `api/*.ts`), so **every 422
across the app** renders "[object Object]" today — not just this call site.
- **Second hazard found in the RED body:** the 422 `detail[].input` **echoes the
  posted body** — i.e. the pasted API key. A naive `JSON.stringify(detail)` would leak
  the write-only key into a toast. The fix therefore extracts the served **`msg`
  text only**, never the object.
- **Fix level: THE COMPONENT / THE STANDARD (Estate-Edit fix-at-the-standard
  precedent).** In `client.ts` `request()`, replace `String(body.detail)` with a
  helper that renders the served reason TEXT: `string` → as-is; validation **array**
  → join the `.msg` fields; object-with-`.msg` → its `.msg`; else `HTTP {status}`.
  D-105: the served string IS the display string, and for a 422 the served reason is
  the `msg`. Fail-first guard: a failed mutation renders the served reason text;
  assert the actual message; assert `"[object"` never appears; assert the echoed
  input value never appears.
- **Accepted-page delta:** the client-error standard is a Settings-touching change
  (the Data feeds tab is an accepted page). Dated delta note in `page-settings.md §16`
  + the SETTINGS pre-pass re-run stated in §13/the report.

### §14dr-2 — OWNER-DECISION, ACCEPTED (2026-07-18): configured-state tables

Read-only, served-strings-only surfacing of existing config. Both **frontend-only**
(verified — the payloads already carry every field; both endpoints already load on
the Data feeds tab). No new components: `DataTable` + `MetaStrip` from the inventory.

1. **Market data card → provider table.** Columns: provider · coverage summary ·
   needs key · key SET/NOT SET · active marker · tier note (where served). Sources
   already loaded on the tab: `/system/providers` serves `active` (active marker) and
   `capabilities[name]` (`asset_classes`, `regions` → coverage; `needs_key` → needs
   key); `/system/data-source` serves `has_api_key` and `av_tier` (`app/…/system.py:96-148`).
   **No additive field, no backend change.** Honest key rendering under the single
   shared key slot (`LEDGERFRAME_MARKET_API_KEY` — one value, not per-provider):
   `needs_key=false` → "Not needed"; `needs_key=true` → SET / NOT SET from the one
   stored-key fact (`has_api_key`). The active marker distinguishes which provider the
   key actually serves; the tier note (`av_tier`) shows on the active `alphavantage`
   row. **Never the key value** — SET/NOT SET only (write-only stands).
2. **News feeds card → configured-feeds list.** `/news/feeds` already serves
   `{feeds, defaults}` (`app/…/news.py:162`); the list is displayed read-only in the
   card (the *Edit feeds…* Dialog stays the editor). Frontend-only. Empty state honest:
   "No feeds configured."
3. Both are **accepted-page-settings surfaces**: dated delta notes in
   `page-settings.md §16` + the SETTINGS pre-pass re-run stated in the report.

**Re-run + STOP.** Phase 3a re-run on the reset demo instance: key-save exercised
end-to-end (a keyed save SUCCEEDS + key-state shows SET; a rejected save shows the
served reason verbatim), both new tables at all widths, 0 console errors, suites +
contract + frontend exit 0. Screenshots: the fixed save (success AND an honest
rejection), both tables, the empty states. `git push`. STOP — the owner re-walks.

---

## §15 — PHASE 3b FIX + RE-RUN EXECUTION RECORD (2026-07-18)

Both findings fixed verify-first (fail-first RED on the real cause), small commits,
docs-first.

- **DONE — §14 findings filed first** (`931eb44`) — dr-1 (real cause + systemic
  surface + the key-leak hazard) and dr-2 (verified frontend-only) recorded before
  any fix.
- **DONE — §14dr-1 fix** (`e1ce9f1`) — **backend** `DataSourceIn.provider` →
  optional (partial-update; unknown-provider 400 still fires when sent; note
  conditional); **client.ts** `detailToText` renders the served reason TEXT,
  `msg`-only (no `[object Object]`, no leaked `input`/key). Contract regen same
  commit (`provider` required→nullable; **134 path-keys held**). Fail-first:
  backend key-only 200 + provider-unchanged + no `"None"` note; client 422-array →
  `msg`, asserts no `"[object"` and no leaked key.
- **DONE — §14dr-2 fix** (`049af20`) — provider `DataTable` (`ProviderTable`) +
  news-feeds `DataTable`, served facts only, no new component, no backend change;
  `av_tier` declared on the `DataSource` reader type (already served); the §9-7
  routing test's bare `findByText("Active")` scoped to the status chip.
  `page-settings.md §16` accepted-page delta notes (dr-1 + dr-2).

### Phase 3b re-run — RESULT (isolated demo instance; owner instance untouched)

Isolated **production-mode** backend on spare port **8399** (own temp data dir,
demo-seeded) + a throwaway Vite dev on **5199** proxying to it (owner's 5173→8321 →
`~/.ledgerframe-data` never touched; §15c). The one instance mutation that reaches
the repo — `apply_env` writing `.env` on the key-save — was **snapshotted before and
restored after** (verified: `.env` back to `MARKET_API_KEY=` empty); the throwaway
Vite config and temp data dir were removed. Working tree clean.

- **Key-save FIXED end-to-end:** the exact previously-broken body
  `PUT /system/data-source {api_key}` → **200** (was 422); `has_api_key` → true; the
  UI Save-key flow shows **"API key saved (stored, hidden)."** and the provider table
  key state shows **SET** with the key value **never** displayed (`•••••• (set)`).
- **Honest rejection rendered verbatim:** the kite→US add returns 400; the
  `role="alert"` shows **"kite doesn't cover US"** (asserted exactly) — the
  client-error standard renders the served reason, **`[object` never appears** on the
  page.
- **§14dr-2 tables live:** provider table (alphavantage · Active · SET · tier `free`;
  no-key providers `Not needed`), news-feeds list (3 configured URLs read-only), and
  the honest empty state **"No feeds configured."** after clearing.
- **Widths + console:** Data feeds tab captured at **320/375/900/1366**; **0
  unexpected console errors** — the single console entry is the browser logging the
  **intentional kite→US 400** as a failed resource (the §13-documented expected
  rejection, not a defect).
- **Gates:** backend **922 passed** (+2 dr-1 pins); `make api-contract-check` green,
  contract **134 path-keys** (Flag 1 held); frontend `npm run check` **exit 0**
  (lint+typecheck+tokens+**vitest incl. dr-1 client + dr-2 table/feeds pins**+**334
  overflow/tile e2e** incl. the taller Data feeds tab).
- **Screenshots (10):** the fixed save success toast; the honest rejection verbatim;
  the provider table; the news-feeds list; the empty-feeds state; the Data feeds tab
  at all four widths.

**One interpretive point for the owner re-walk (raised, not improvised):** under the
**single shared key slot** (`LEDGERFRAME_MARKET_API_KEY` is one value, not
per-provider), the provider table renders **SET on every needs-key row** from the one
stored-key fact — so `eodhd`/`kite` read SET while `alphavantage` is the active,
keyed provider. The active marker distinguishes which provider the key actually
serves. The honest alternative (SET/NOT SET only on the active row) is a one-line
change if the owner prefers it; recorded in `page-settings.md §16-2`.

**STATUS: FIXED + RE-RUN GREEN. NEXT: the owner re-walks** (Phase 3b, judgment only),
then the close ritual.

---

## §16 — PHASE 3b RE-WALK (batch 2) — FINDINGS (2026-07-18)

The owner **re-walked** the live Data feeds tab after the batch-1 fixes (dr-1/dr-2
**ACCEPTED** — key saves; matrix-priced AAPL live via `alphavantage`). **Three new
findings** (the `§14dr-*` series continues) **+ one ruling** on the key-slot point
raised in batch 1. Filed here **first** (this docs commit), then fixed verify-first:
environment gate · fail-first RED on the **real cause** · frontend exit code · **no
mutating smokes on the owner's live instance** (an isolated demo stack only).
Accepted-page touches (Pricing Health, Instrument Detail, Settings) get dated delta
notes + their pre-pass re-runs.

### §14dr-3 — BUG / SPEC-GAP: stale holdings are not identifiable on Pricing Health

**Reproduce:** Pricing Health. The Stale banner + the confidence card both count **2
stale** (`"{n} of {m} prices stale"`, `PricingHealth.tsx:249-252`), but the
per-holding diagnostics table has **no way to show WHICH two** — no stale marker, no
as-of column, and the table is neither sorted nor filtered to surface them. *A
destination that states a count but cannot answer "which ones" only half-answers
(§14ac-2 — destinations that don't answer the question lie too).*

**Verify-first — is staleness already served per-holding? YES (verified, not
guessed).**
- The per-holding payload **already carries `is_stale`** on every row
  (`app/api/v1/routes/portfolio.py:266`, inside the `pricing_health` handler
  `:217-292`); the frontend type **already declares it** (`PricingRow.is_stale`,
  `frontend/src/api/pricing-health.ts:23`; `price_ts` at `:22`).
- The banner/confidence **count** is `stale_count = sum(1 for h in val.holdings if
  h.is_stale)` (`portfolio.py:133`, on `GET /portfolio/summary`), plumbed to the
  chrome via `state/staleCount.ts` (the shared, invalidatable query). Both the
  count **and** the per-row flag derive from the **same** shared reader
  `value_portfolio(...)` — `h.is_stale = quote.is_stale`
  (`app/services/portfolio.py:303`), `val.has_stale` (`:429`) — which the
  pricing-health handler also calls (`portfolio.py:230`). **One derivation already;
  the flag is on the wire per row.**
- Frontend gap only: `PricingHealth.tsx` adds **no** stale column to `columns`
  (`:137-181`) and wires **neither** sort nor filter to the `DataTable` (`:266`) —
  even though the columns are flagged `sortable: true` and `DataTable` supports both
  `sort`/`onSort` and `filter` (`DataTable.tsx:60-62`). So today the "sortable"
  headers are **inert** (no `onSort` → clicks do nothing, `DataTable.tsx:166`).

**Fix level: FRONTEND (render what's served) — smallest ratified-component answer,
NO new component.**
1. **Mark WHICH:** render the served `is_stale` — a **Stale** `StatusChip` in the
   Status cell + an **As of** column (served `price_ts`, date-only). Both from the
   ratified inventory; no backend change.
2. **Make them FINDABLE:** **default-order stale rows to the top** on load (zero
   interaction → identifiable at arrival) **and** wire `DataTable`'s existing
   `sort`/`onSort` (removing the inert-sortable lie — the headers now actually sort).
3. **One source, pinned by reconciliation:** the row markers and the banner count
   both read `is_stale`; a **reconciliation test** asserts *banner count == marked
   rows* — **backend:** `sum(is_stale)` in the pricing-health payload **==**
   `stale_count` on `/portfolio/summary` for the same portfolio (both from
   `value_portfolio`); **frontend:** the count of rendered Stale markers **==** the
   shared `staleCount`.
4. **Journey guard extended:** the stale-banner → Pricing Health journey now asserts
   the stale rows are **identifiable at the destination** (marked + pinned to the
   top), not merely that the page arrived (§14ac-2).
- **Accepted-page delta:** Pricing Health is an accepted page → dated delta note in
  `page-pricing-health.md` + the Pricing Health pre-pass re-run stated in the report.

### §14dr-4 — BUG: the Advanced candle chart renders malformed candles

**Reproduce:** Instrument Detail → **Advanced** view, real daily OHLC (e.g. AAPL via
`alphavantage`, 6M default ≈ 124 bars). Candles render as **crosses** ("+") — the
body reads as a fat plus around the wick, not a filled open→close rectangle.

**Verify-first — the real cause is RENDERING GEOMETRY, not data (verified).**
- **Data is correct.** The served bars are per-field distinct: backend
  `instrument_history` (`app/api/v1/routes/markets.py:465-480`) → alphavantage
  `get_history` (`TIME_SERIES_DAILY`, `app/providers/market/external.py:207-238`);
  the `Candle → PricePoint` mapping is a straight passthrough with no field swap
  (`frontend/src/routes/InstrumentDetail.tsx:102-104`). **Not a data bug.**
- **The chart component is `PriceChart.tsx`**; candle geometry at `:225-236`. Two
  compounding defects at real (dense) density:
  - **(a) Body outline balloons — the dominant "+" cause.** The body `<rect>`
    inherits `.lf-candle--up/--down` (`charts.css:163-164`), which set `stroke` +
    `fill` but — **unlike every sibling series** (`.lf-pricechart__line/__axis/
    __overlay/__bench/__cmp/__cross` all set it, `charts.css:159-162,167,185`) —
    **omit `vector-effect: non-scaling-stroke`**. So the rect gets the SVG default
    **1-user-unit** stroke, scaled **non-uniformly** by `preserveAspectRatio="none"`
    (`PriceChart.tsx:202`) into a fat distorted outline around a thin fill → a cross.
  - **(b) Body width collapses with point density.** `bw = ((X1-X0)/n)*0.5 = 48/n`
    viewBox units (`PriceChart.tsx:229`): ≈1.2 at the 40-point mock (why mocks/tests
    look fine), but ≈**0.39** at 6M daily density — thinner than the wick — so even
    without (a) the body is a sliver.
- **Not covered by tests.** `ui.test.tsx:75-101` only asserts candle elements
  *exist* (count > 0), never geometry, and uses the 40-point `PRICE_SERIES` — the
  dense-daily case is untested.

**Fix level: THE CHART COMPONENT / THE STANDARD (fix-at-standard).**
- **(a)** `.lf-candle` bodies render **fill-only** (no scaled outline); the wick
  keeps a **crisp non-scaling stroke** — parity with every sibling series
  (`charts.css`).
- **(b)** Body width becomes **band-based with a readable floor and a no-overlap
  clamp**: `slot=(X1-X0)/n; bw=min(slot, max(slot*0.7, 0.6))` — readable at 1M/6M
  density, never wider than its slot (no overlap) at 1Y/Max.
- **Fail-first regression with a real-shaped fixture** (a dense ~130-bar daily OHLC
  series, body between open/close, wick to high/low): a **unit geometry test** (RED
  on the collapsed width at 6M density; asserts body spans open→close, wick spans
  high→low, up/down class) **+ an e2e box-geometry test** (RED on the cross:
  measures the rendered body box vs the wick — a body must read as a rectangle, not
  a ~square plus — *assert geometry, not pixels-by-eye*). Both green after.
- **Fix-at-standard sweep — every consumer:** `PriceChart` candle mode is used by
  **Instrument Detail** (the report) and the **kitchen-sink** candles specimen;
  **Portfolio / Net worth** use it in `mode="line"` only (unaffected). The fix is at
  the component, so all candle consumers inherit it; a **dense candle specimen** is
  added to the kitchen sink so the e2e can measure it offline/deterministically.
- **Accepted-page delta:** Instrument Detail → dated delta note in
  `page-instrument-detail.md` + the Instrument Detail pre-pass re-run.

### §14dr-5 — ENHANCEMENT (owner-ruled): zoom on the Advanced chart

**Scope (owner ruling, minimal — nothing beyond this):** **wheel/pinch zoom + a
reset affordance**, **Advanced view only**, **no persistence**, ratified
components/iconography (DESIGN-SYSTEM §5.4 button anatomy for the reset control).

**Fix level: `PriceChart.tsx` (Advanced mode).** A local visible-window state
(`[start,end]` over the series); **wheel** zooms about the cursor, **pinch** (touch)
zooms, a ratified **Button** ("Reset zoom", shown only when Advanced + zoomed)
restores the full range. State is **local** — it resets on unmount / period change
(no persistence, no served field, no contract change). Overflow/smoke coverage for
the interaction (zoom changes the visible candle count; reset restores it) at all
widths. Same Instrument Detail delta note.

### §14 KEY-SLOT HONESTY — RULING (from the batch-1 raised point) + ROADMAP R-41

The batch-1 re-run raised (honestly, `§15` closing note; `page-settings.md §16-2`)
that the provider table renders **SET on every needs-key row** from the single shared
`has_api_key` fact (`Settings.tsx:471`), so `eodhd`/`kite` read SET while
`alphavantage` is the active, keyed provider. The owner **ruled**:

1. **Honest per-row key state (this milestone, frontend).** The table shows **SET**
   only on the row the shared slot **actually serves** — the **active keyed
   provider** — labelled so the shared-slot fact is explicit (**"shared key slot"**);
   **other needs-key rows show NOT SET** with honest copy (**"uses the shared slot —
   currently serving {provider}"**). The strings compose from **served facts**
   (`providers.active` · per-provider `needs_key` · the shared `has_api_key`, all
   already on the tab) — the same served-facts composition the **accepted §14dr-2**
   table uses (D-105; provider names are served vocab). **No backend change, no new
   field** (per-provider credentials are R-41, below). `page-settings.md §16` delta
   note; the two `ProviderTable` tests updated to the multi-needs-key case that
   exposed the bug.
2. **ROADMAP R-41 — per-provider credentials (filed 2026-07-18, surfaced by R-38).**
   The routing matrix invites **multiple keyed providers concurrently**; the single
   shared `LEDGERFRAME_MARKET_API_KEY` slot **cannot** support that. **Scope sketch:**
   per-provider write-only key storage; the Settings key control gains a **provider
   dimension**; the matrix caveat chip keys off **per-provider** credentials.
   **PARKED — owner prioritises** (release-scope candidate). Cross-ref: this §16 and
   the `ROADMAP.md` R-41 row.

### Re-run + STOP

Phase 3a re-run on the **reset demo instance** (owner instance untouched): stale rows
identifiable **end-to-end** (banner → page → the two rows); the candle fixture test
green + the chart **visually sane at 1D/1M/1Y**; zoom works at all widths; the
key-slot display honest; **0 console errors**; suites + contract (**134** held) +
frontend **exit code** + **both** accepted-page pre-passes (Pricing Health +
Instrument Detail) stated. Screenshots: Pricing Health with the stale rows found; the
repaired candles (1M); zoom in action; the key-slot table. `git push`. **STOP — the
owner re-walks.**

---

## §17 — PHASE 3b (batch 2) FIX + RE-RUN EXECUTION RECORD (2026-07-18)

All four items fixed verify-first (fail-first RED on the real cause), docs-first,
small commits.

- **DONE — §16 findings filed first** (`8566437`) — dr-3/dr-4/dr-5 + the key-slot
  ruling + ROADMAP R-41, recorded before any fix.
- **DONE — §14dr-3** (`298827a`) — `is_stale` **already served** per-row (verified);
  rendered as a **Stale marker** in the Status cell + **default-ordered stale-to-top**
  + wired the previously-**inert** `DataTable` sort. Reconciliation pin (backend):
  `sum(is_stale)` in pricing-health `==` `/portfolio/summary.stale_count`; frontend
  guard: marked rows == the stale rows, pinned to top; dev-smoke journey now asserts
  **identifiability at the destination**. `page-pricing-health.md` delta note.
- **DONE — §14dr-4** (`a90d776`) — verify-first the served OHLC is correct; the defect
  is **rendering geometry** in `PriceChart`. Fix at the component standard: candle
  bodies **fill-only** + wick **non-scaling stroke** (parity with every sibling
  series), body width **band-based with a readable floor + no-overlap clamp**.
  Fail-first: `DENSE_CANDLE_SERIES` (~130 real-shaped daily bars) + kitchen-sink
  specimen back a unit geometry test (RED on the collapsed width) **and** an e2e
  box-geometry test (RED on the cross bloom). Sweep: all candle consumers inherit the
  component fix. `page-instrument-detail.md` delta note.
- **DONE — §14dr-5** (`ac20409` + e2e delivery fix in the same series) — wheel + pinch
  zoom about the cursor, **Advanced only**, ratified **Reset** Button,
  **non-persistent** (a new series clears it), no served field. Unit + e2e interaction
  coverage (the e2e dispatches a real `WheelEvent` — `page.mouse.wheel` didn't reach
  the non-passive listener in headless Chromium). `page-instrument-detail.md` delta note.
- **DONE — key-slot honesty** (`43999dc`) — **SET only on the active keyed provider
  row** (labelled "shared key slot"); every other needs-key row **NOT SET** with
  honest copy *"uses the shared slot — currently serving {provider}"*. Composed from
  served facts (the §14dr-2 pattern), no backend change. Test exposing the bug
  (multi-needs-key: exactly one SET). `page-settings.md §16-2` revised; ROADMAP R-41
  filed for real per-provider credentials.

### Phase 3b re-run — RESULT (isolated demo instance; owner instance untouched)

Isolated **production-seeded** backend on spare port **8399** (own temp data dir,
`LEDGERFRAME_DEMO_SEED`) + a throwaway **Vite dev** on **5199** proxying to it
(owner's 5173→8321→`~/.ledgerframe-data` never touched; §15c). The `.env` write
hazard (`apply_env` on the provider/key saves) was **snapshotted before and restored
after** — verified `.env` **identical to the snapshot**; the throwaway Vite config +
temp data dir removed; **working tree clean**.

- **§14dr-3 — stale rows identifiable END-TO-END:** staleness induced honestly on the
  isolated instance (a short `stale_after_seconds`; mock's cached quotes age past it).
  Banner **"7 prices are stale"** → confidence card **"7 of 14 prices stale — the same
  count the Stale banner shows (one shared reader)"** → the per-holding table shows the
  **7 stale rows MARKED (Stale chip) and PINNED to the top** — `banner == marked ==
  the top rows` asserted live. Header sort now wired (a Holding-header click re-sorts).
- **§14dr-4 — candles repaired:** at **1M** (21 candles) and **1Y** (125 candles) the
  bodies render as **filled rectangles** (no overlap; max body width < candle pitch —
  the cross bloom is gone), asserted by rendered-box geometry. **1D** shows ~2 candles
  honestly (daily feed). Visually sane in the screenshots.
- **§14dr-5 — zoom:** a real wheel narrows the window (21 → 17 candles) and the
  ratified **Reset zoom** control appears; Reset restores the full range. No horizontal
  overflow while zoomed.
- **Key-slot honest:** with the active provider `alphavantage` keyed → **exactly one
  SET** ("shared key slot"), and `eodhd`/`kite` read **NOT SET** with *"uses the shared
  slot — currently serving alphavantage"*; no-key providers read "Not needed".
- **0 console errors · 0 overflow** across Pricing Health / Instrument Detail / Settings
  Data feeds at 320/375/900/1366 × light/dark. (Clean-console via the Vite-dev stack —
  no prod-CSP theme-flash error.)
- **Gates:** backend **923 passed**; `make api-contract-check` green, contract **134
  path-keys** (Flag 1 held — no endpoints added); frontend `npm run check` **exit 0**
  (lint + typecheck + tokens + **vitest 288** incl. the dr-3/dr-4/dr-5 + key-slot pins
  + **e2e 336** incl. the new `candle-geometry.spec.ts` geometry + zoom guards).
- **Screenshots (6):** Pricing Health with the stale rows found; the repaired candles
  at 1D/1M/1Y; zoom in action (Reset visible); the key-slot provider table.

**BOTH accepted-page pre-passes stated:** Pricing Health (dr-3) and Instrument Detail
(dr-4/dr-5) were driven end-to-end on the isolated instance; Settings Data feeds
(key-slot) likewise.

**STATUS: FIXED + RE-RUN GREEN. NEXT: the owner re-walks** (Phase 3b, judgment only),
then the close ritual.
