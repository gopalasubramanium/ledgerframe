# page-instrument-detail.md — Instrument Detail build plan

**Status: BUILD APPROVED (owner, 2026-07-10) — ND-1..ND-5 resolved.** Second
instantiation of `TEMPLATE-page-build.md`; first **entity-detail** variant.

**ND resolutions (owner, 2026-07-10):**
- **ND-1 — position-if-held:** a **`symbol` filter param on the existing holdings
  reader** (`GET /portfolio/holdings?symbol=`) — P-3: a scoped view is a *filter of
  the canonical reader*, **no new endpoint**. Contract delta, same commit.
- **ND-2 + ND-5 — AI explainer DEFERRED to the AI-surfaces milestone.** The
  **Ask-panel** component is built there (serving chat + instrument explainer +
  report helper) with its own DESIGN-SYSTEM amendment + ratification. **This page
  ships without the explainer section.** D-068 stays intact — recorded as
  **explicitly pending**, not dropped.
- **ND-3 — approved:** add a `source_override` vocab to `/refdata`.
- **ND-4 — approved:** type `GET /instruments/{symbol}`, same-commit contract regen.

## 1. IDENTITY

| Field | Value | Spec ref |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Page name (H1 = symbol/name) | Instrument Detail | IA §2 |
| Route | `/instrument/:symbol` | IA §2 (IA line 93/360) |
| Nav group | none — reached by any symbol link (not a sidebar item) | IA §2 (line 93) |
| Page template | **Entity-detail** (header + identity/taxonomy + related panels + scoped readers) | DESIGN-SYSTEM §3 |
| Rotation eligibility | No (record-scoped, not a dashboard) | IA §3 |
| One-line purpose | A **scoped view (P-3)** of the quote / news / portfolio readers for one instrument; edit its taxonomy; set ongoing cost; explain it (P-6). **Canonical home for nothing.** | IA §360 (D-037, D-068) |

**Already links here (must not dead-end):** the Holdings row **Details** action and
the **D-097 cross-class** links both navigate to `#/instrument/:symbol` today — this
page is what makes them resolve.

---

## 2. OWNERSHIP TABLE

**This page OWNS nothing** — IA §360: "Not a canonical home for anything it shows."
Everything is a P-3 scoped view of a canonical reader, or an edit of the instrument
record. This is the defining constraint (P-1/P-3).

**Summarises (scoped views via the named reader, never recomputed):**

| Summary shown | Canonical page | Shared reader reused | Link target |
|---------------|----------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Quote + provenance + staleness | Markets | `display_quote` / market reader | Markets |
| Price history chart | Markets | `/instruments/{symbol}/history` reader | Markets |
| Scoped news | News | `/instruments/{symbol}/news` (D-037) | News |
| Position if held (qty / value / unrealised P/L) | Portfolio (Holdings) | `value_portfolio`, filtered to this instrument (P-3) | Holdings / Portfolio |
| Ongoing cost (expense ratio) | Portfolio ongoing-cost | ongoing-cost reader (D-029) | Ongoing cost |

**Owns (record edit, not a "figure"):** the instrument **record** edit
(asset_class / listing_country / name / source_override) and its ongoing-cost
setting — these are record mutations, not canonical figures.

**Links to:** Markets · News · Holdings/Portfolio · Pricing Health (provenance).

**Enforcement corollary (P-1/D-031):** every figure here is rendered by the
canonical reader and **carries a link** to its canonical page; this page adds **no
figure** its canonical page does not show. State this in the build.

## 3. API SURFACE

### 3a. Endpoints consumed (already in the frozen contract)

| Method + path | Purpose on this page | Response shape pinned? |
|---------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| `GET /instruments/{symbol}` | Identity, taxonomy, quote, provenance, mapped-provider detail | Partially — verify (§9) |
| `GET /instruments/{symbol}/history` | Price history → PriceChart | Verify shape |
| `GET /instruments/{symbol}/news` | Scoped news (D-037, P-3) | Verify shape |
| `PATCH /instruments/{symbol}` | Edit asset_class / country / name / source_override | Pinned (`InstrumentPatch`) |
| `PUT /instruments/{symbol}/ongoing-cost` | Set ongoing cost (D-029) | Pinned |
| `GET /portfolio/pricing-health` | Provenance/why-this-number for this symbol (filter) | Pinned |
| `POST /ai/facts` + `POST /ai/chat` (or `/briefing`) | "Explain this instrument" (P-6, D-068) — grounded + validated | Verify which powers the explainer |
| `POST /instruments/{symbol}/map-{amfi,coingecko,kite}` | Provider mapping (pricing correctness) | Pinned |

### 3b. Contract deltas (needed but not in the baseline — BUILD BACKEND-FIRST)

| kind | Endpoint (current → intended) | Decision | Why this page needs it |
|------|-------------------------------|----------|------------------------|
| *(candidate)* reshape/add | **Position-if-held for one instrument** — a scoped read (`GET /instruments/{symbol}/position` or a documented client-side filter of the holdings reader) | P-3 / D-023 | The "position if held" panel must reuse `value_portfolio`, never recompute (§9). Decide: scoped endpoint vs documented filter of the existing typed holdings response. |
| *(verify)* reshape | `GET /instruments/{symbol}` response typing | §9-6 hygiene | If untyped (`additionalProperties`), pin an explicit footprint like the Holdings reshape. |

*Each delta is built backend-first and regenerates `API-CONTRACT.json` +
`docs/openapi.json` in the same commit.*

## 4. COMPONENTS

| Ratified component | Role on this page | Data source (real / **mock**) | Prop/state not exercised at kitchen-sink |
|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| PageHeader | Symbol + name + actions (Edit, Explain) | — | — |
| PriceChart | Price history (house-SVG, D-053) | `…/history` (real) | Long/empty/stale history |
| ProvenanceBadge | Source · freshness · confidence | `/instruments/{symbol}` (real) | Unavailable / low-confidence |
| StalenessChip | Stale flag + as-of (compact, §9-32) | `/instruments/{symbol}` (real) | — |
| DataTable | This instrument's transactions (if held); news list | portfolio/news readers (real) | — |
| MasterSelect | Edit: asset_class, listing_country, source_override | `/refdata` (real) | — |
| TextInput | Edit: display name | — | — |
| MoneyInput / PercentInput | Ongoing cost entry | — | — |
| Dialog | Edit-instrument + set-ongoing-cost editors | — | Popover-inside-dialog (verify §7) |
| EmptyState | Unpriced / no-history / not-held / no-news reasons | — | — |

**Data source rule (retrospective):** the **explainer (P-6)** and **news** must be
wired to the **real** grounded/validated pipeline and news reader — a mock here
would pass tests while fabricating (Product Guarantee 3). Flag any mock in §9.

**Component usage rules to honour:**
- **Row actions** (transactions-of-this-instrument table) → `RowMenu` (⋯); no wide
  action columns.
- **Popover overlay (DESIGN-SYSTEM §6)** — the edit dialog's `MasterSelect`/
  `DateInput` overlay within the viewport; verify open **inside the dialog**.
- **Context-scoped picker** — N/A (we are on an instrument); but `source_override`
  is a provider select bound to `/refdata`, not free text.

**Tables — dataset-size posture (D-094):** the "transactions of this instrument"
table is **bounded** (one instrument's own trades — tens of rows) → client-side
sort/filter, threshold-noted. The news list is bounded (reader-capped).

---

## 4b. PER-VARIANT FIELD & ACTION SPECS

The instrument has **no create-form variants** (it already exists), but its
**mapped-provider detail panel is class-conditional** (a display variant, from
`/instruments/{symbol}` `detail`):

| Class (variant) | Class-specific panel shown | Served by |
|-----------------|----------------------------|-----------|
| mutual_fund | AMFI: fund house, category, ISIN, official NAV + date | `/instruments/{symbol}` `detail.mutual_fund` |
| crypto | CoinGecko: canonical id, symbol, market cap | `detail.crypto` |
| derivative | F&O identity: expiry / strike / lot / segment | `detail.derivative` |
| equity / etf / other | Exchange · sector · country only (no extra panel) | base fields |

Edit form fields are the same for all classes (`InstrumentPatch`:
asset_class / country / name / source_override) — **served by `/refdata`**, never
hardcoded.

---

## 5. VOCABULARIES

| Field | Vocabulary / master | Fixed (/refdata) or extensible | MASTER-DATA ref |
|-------|---------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------|
| asset_class | `asset_class` | fixed (/refdata) | MASTER-DATA §2 |
| listing_country | country / region model | fixed | MASTER-DATA §4 |
| source_override | provider routing (market/amfi/coingecko/kite/auto) | fixed | MASTER-DATA (routing) — verify vocab (§9) |
| sector (display) | sector master | extensible | MASTER-DATA §6 |

Name is free text → **TextInput** (not categorical).

---

## 6. DECISIONS IN FORCE

| Decision | What it forbids / requires here |
|----------|---------------------------------|
| **P-3 / D-037** | This is a scoped view; quote/news are filters of canonical readers — never a second code path. |
| **P-1 / D-031** | Owns nothing; every figure links to its canonical page and adds nothing extra. |
| **D-068 / P-6** | The "explain this instrument" rides the single grounded+validated pipeline; **no direct model call**; ends with the info-only disclaimer; ephemeral (D-016). |
| **D-029** | "Ongoing cost (expense ratio)" naming (retires "Cost of ownership"). |
| **D-053** | Price history uses the house-SVG PriceChart (ECharts only via the treemap escape hatch — N/A here). |
| **D-072** | Provider mapping / source_override is visible + editable; priority-editing stays out. |
| **Guarantee 3** | Unpriced/stale/unavailable render "—" + reason; the explainer never fabricates a number. |
| **D-097 / §6 popover** | Edit-dialog selects overlay within the viewport (portal rule). |

---

## 7. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

- [ ] **Happy path:** a held, priced instrument shows quote+provenance, history chart, position, ongoing cost, news; all figures link to their canonical page.
- [ ] **Empty/honest states:** not-held → "Not in your portfolio" (reason); no history → reason; unpriced → "—" + reason; no news → reason; **explainer unavailable → visible fallback** (D-070), never fabricated.
- [ ] **Stale / low-confidence:** flagged via StalenessChip/ProvenanceBadge, never hidden.
- [ ] **Class-conditional panel** renders the right provider detail (mutual_fund NAV / crypto cap / derivative F&O) and nothing for plain equity.
- [ ] **Edit** (asset_class/country/name/source_override) + **set ongoing cost** persist via the pinned endpoints; categoricals from `/refdata`.
- [ ] **Both densities + both themes**; **interactive open states** (edit-dialog selects) checked in both themes.
- [ ] **No frontend money math**; terms match GLOSSARY; categoricals via /refdata.
- [ ] **Round-trip (D-095):** N/A (no export/import surface here).
- [ ] **Request-body assertion:** edit + ongoing-cost submits assert the actual request body.
- [ ] **Rendered layout verification (1366 & 1920, both themes):** header + chart + panels fit; the edit dialog's open selects overlay without dialog scroll (rendered, not unit-tested).
- [ ] **Context-scoped picker (D-097):** N/A (no instrument picker on this page).
- [ ] **P-3 proof:** quote/news/position come from the canonical readers (same code path), verified by matching the canonical page's numbers.

## 8. BUILD PHASES

- **Phase 0 — Contract deltas (§3b):** decide + build the position-if-held read and any response-typing; regenerate contract same commit; drift green.
- **Phase 1 — Page assembly:** entity-detail template; compose ratified components; wire real readers (quote/history/news/position/ongoing-cost/explainer); honest empty/stale/unavailable states.
- **Phase 2 — Tests:** render tests + acceptance criteria; request-body assertions; drift/typecheck/lint green.
- **Phase 3 — Owner acceptance walk (LIVE):** drive the real app — priced vs unpriced vs unavailable, held vs not-held, each class's panel, the explainer's fallback, the edit dialog's popovers, layout at 1366/1920 both themes (rendered/screenshot). Findings → numbered §9-* entries, fixed and re-verified live. **Done only after this walk.**

## 9. NEEDS DECISION *(surface to owner BEFORE build)*

| # | Item | Why it blocks / what's needed | Proposed resolution (for owner) |
|---|------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| ND-1 | **Position-if-held read** (§3b) | Must reuse `value_portfolio` (P-3), never recompute. | Add a small scoped endpoint `GET /instruments/{symbol}/position` returning the canonical per-holding view, OR document a client-side filter of the typed holdings response. Recommend the scoped endpoint (keeps the frontend math-free). |
| ND-2 | **Which pipeline powers "explain this instrument"** | `/ai/facts` + `/ai/chat` vs `/briefing` — must ride P-6, show the fact-pack before the answer, be ephemeral. | Confirm the endpoint(s) + whether an **Ask panel** component exists/needs a DESIGN-SYSTEM amendment (mock-backed explainer is forbidden — Guarantee 3). |
| ND-3 | **`source_override` vocabulary** (§5) | Categorical must reference a master; is the provider-routing set in `/refdata`? | If absent, add a `source_routing` fixed vocab to `/refdata` (contract delta) or confirm the existing key. |
| ND-4 | **`GET /instruments/{symbol}` response typing** (§3b) | If untyped, pin a footprint (Holdings §9-6 hygiene). | Reshape to an explicit typed response before assembly. |
| ND-5 | **Ask-panel component** | If the explainer needs a streaming panel affordance the inventory lacks → DESIGN-SYSTEM amendment (new components forbidden without one). | Decide at kitchen-sink: reuse existing primitives vs amend. |

---

**Sign-off to start build:** ND-1..ND-5 resolved · §3b deltas approved · no §4
component needs an unresolved amendment · no affordance left mock-backed (§4).
