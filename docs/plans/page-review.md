# page-review.md — Review page build plan

**Status: DONE ✅ — page ACCEPTED (owner, 2026-07-13).** Phases 0/0a/1/2/3a + Phase-3b owner walk Batch 1
(§12rv1-1..7) all complete; owner live-re-verified and closed the page. §12rv1-1 icon + §12rv1-4 severity
colours + the ND-11 GLOSSARY terms (Mark reviewed + Severity) RATIFIED. Full record: §9 (decisions), §10
(verify-first), §11 (build), §12 (walk), §13 (retrospective). Drafted 2026-07-13 from
`TEMPLATE-page-build.md` (incl. the tooling-guard fail-first, the ⚠ verify-first divergence-flag +
**audit-guards** additions, the vertical-single-scroll invariant, and the Reports-group worklist-shape
note). Verify-first pass done (§10 — read what the review reader actually serves **and its honesty
guards**, D-019 / page-news §13a). **Nothing is built.** Every ambiguity is in §9; the owner resolves
them one-pass. **I resolved none.**

Review is a **Planning-group** page (Review · Policy · Cash flow · Scenarios · Insurance · Estate, IA
§3) and the **canonical home for review verdicts + the attention list, Mark-reviewed (with history),
and the D-059 threshold-constants table** (IA §5, D-038/D-059). **Building it unblocks Home** — Net
worth's / Home's **`ReviewCard`** already reads the Review reader (D-038); Review is the last unbuilt
canonical source Home summarises. It is **worklist-shaped** (a summary header + an attention/records
body — page-pricing-health §13 ND-7); the **IA nav group is Planning** (CURRENT.md's "Reports-group"
phrasing refers only to the *shape*).

> **⚠ THREE things dominate this plan (read first):** **(1) The code diverges from the owner-set
> thresholds.** `review.py` still serves **`_RUNWAY_LOW_MONTHS = 6`** and **`_GOAL_SOON_DAYS = 90`**;
> **D-084** set these to **3** and **180**, and **D-087**'s `_OTHER_CLASS_OVERUSE_PCT = 10%` signal is
> **absent from the code** — PRODUCT-SPEC §5 records the divergence (ND-1). **(2) The D-030 rename is
> not applied** — the endpoint is `/review/centre`, not `/review` (API-CONTRACT delta; ND-2). **(3) Two
> readers, reconciled by construction** — `/review/centre` (sections + attention, **currently
> unconsumed**) reuses `review_report`, the same reader `/portfolio/review` (ReviewCard) uses; P-1
> single-fetch is ND-3.

## 1. IDENTITY

*Source: INFORMATION-ARCHITECTURE.md §2 (page map), §3 (nav + rotation); DESIGN-SYSTEM.md §3.*

| Field | Value | Spec ref |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Page name (H1 = nav label = route) | **Review** | IA §2, D-022, D-030 |
| Route | `/review` | IA §2 |
| Nav group | **Planning** (Review · Policy · Cash flow · Scenarios · Insurance · Estate) | IA §3 |
| Page template | **Worklist** — a summary header (section verdicts + last-review) over an **attention/records body** (attention list + history) | DESIGN-SYSTEM §3; pricing-health §13 ND-7 |
| Rotation eligibility | **Confirm ND-6** (any nav page is eligible, D-044; pricing-health ND-10 precedent = YES) — IA is not Review-specific | IA §3 (D-044) |
| One-line purpose | **Review** — a live "what needs a look" attention list from existing signals + a per-section verdict; **Mark-reviewed** snapshots state to `ReviewLog` with a note + next-review date; review history. Reporting only, never advice or a required action. | IA §2/§5 |

---

## 2. OWNERSHIP TABLE

*Copied from INFORMATION-ARCHITECTURE.md §5 (Review). Never re-derived.*

**Owns (canonical, authoritative, fully explained here):**
- **Section verdicts + the attention list** — the served `attention[]` items (`{area, title, severity}`)
  and per-section verdict; each item's `area` links to its canonical page (ND-7).
- **Mark-reviewed** — records a `ReviewLog` (net worth, confidence, drift flags, attention count, **note
  + next-review date**) via `POST /review/log` (`require_auth`, `[S]`); **review history**.
- **The D-059 threshold-constants table** — **PRODUCT-SPEC §5 names the Review page spec as the
  canonical home** for this table; it is carried below (each a named constant + one-line rationale).

**Summarises (other pages' info — via the named canonical reader, never recomputed):**

| Summary shown | Canonical page | Shared reader reused | Link target |
|---------------|----------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Drift / out-of-band (policy section) | Policy | **`compute_drift`** (`services/policy.py`) — the same reader Policy uses | Policy |
| Runway (liquidity section) | Net worth / Cash flow | **`runway_report`** (`services/runway.py`) — the Net-worth reader | Net worth / Cash flow |
| Trust / confidence (trust section) | Pricing Health | confidence/staleness readers (D-038) | Pricing Health |
| Net worth + day change (header/changed section) | Net worth | **`value_portfolio`** | Net worth |

**Links to (each attention `area` → its canonical page, ND-7):** **Policy** (`policy`), **Pricing
Health** (`data` — confidence/staleness/incomplete/expense-ratio), **Cash flow / Net worth**
(`liquidity`, `runway`), **Scenarios / Planning** (`goals`, `obligations`), **Insurance**
(`insurance`), **Estate** (`estate`), **Holdings / InstrumentDetail** (`corporate`).

**Enforcement corollary (P-1/D-031):** the section verdicts + attention items are **served display
values** from `review_centre`/`review_report`; the page performs **no money math**. **`ReviewCard`
shows no figure the Review page doesn't** (D-038; the component "reuses the Review reader's verdicts —
it never computes its own"). Home / Net worth **summarise** Review (ReviewCard), linked here.

### The D-059 threshold-constants table (canonical here — PRODUCT-SPEC §5)

*Values per D-084 (owner-set) / D-087 / D-091. **⚠ the running code diverges — see ND-1 + §10.***

| Constant | Value | Signal | Rationale |
|----------|-------|--------|-----------|
| `_LIQUID_THIN_PCT` | 15 (%) | Liquidity thin when `liquid_pct` < 15% | Below ~1/7 of gross assets in immediate/short rungs is too little cushion. |
| `_RUNWAY_LOW_MONTHS` | **3** (D-084) | Runway low when `runway_months` < 3 | Owner-set floor: below three months' recurring net burn warrants a look. |
| `_GOAL_SOON_DAYS` | **180** (D-084) | Goal target date within 180 days | Owner-set: a half-year's notice to act on an approaching goal. |
| `_OBLIGATION_SOON_DAYS` | 30 | Obligation due within 30 days | One month's notice on an upcoming cash obligation. |
| `_INSURANCE_SOON_DAYS` | 30 | Insurance renewal within 30 days (or overdue) | One month to renew before a policy lapses; overdue always flags. |
| `_CORP_ACTION_RECENT_DAYS` | 45 | Split/bonus within 45 days → "verify" | Recent corporate actions warrant a manual verification window. |
| `LEDGERFRAME_STALE_AFTER_SECONDS` | 900 | Stale holding count | Quotes older than 15 min flagged stale (EOD/NAV use a longer 30h threshold). |
| `_OTHER_CLASS_OVERUSE_PCT` | 10 (%) (D-087) | `other`-class holdings exceed ~10% of gross assets | `other` is the honest escape valve; over-use signals holdings to reclassify. |
| `_INCOMPLETE_DETAILS_MIN` | **1** (D-091) | Manual holdings in {fixed_deposit, bond, property, retirement, private} with **no** optional detail | Low-priority `info` nudge to enrich a bare-value holding — *never a hard wall*. |

---

## 3. API SURFACE

*Source: API-CONTRACT.json (frozen) + API-CONTRACT.md delta table. Verify-first shapes in §10.*

### 3a. Endpoints consumed (already in the frozen contract)

| Method + path | Purpose on this page | Response shape (verified §10) |
|---------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| `GET /review/centre` **(→ `/review`, ND-2)** | the Review page body — sections + attention | `{base_currency, net_worth, sections:{trust,policy,liquidity,goals,changed}, attention:[{area,title,severity}], attention_count, last_review, disclaimer}` — `attention` = `review_report.items` (by-construction, ND-3) |
| `GET /portfolio/review` | **ReviewCard's** feed (Home/Net worth) — **not fetched by this page** unless ND-3 shares it | `{as_of, count, items:[{area,title,severity}], disclaimer}` |
| `GET /review/history` | review-history table | `{history:[{id,reviewed_at,days_ago,net_worth,base_currency,confidence,drift_flags,attention_count,note,next_review_date}]}` |
| `POST /review/log` (**`require_auth`**) | **Mark-reviewed** (`[S]`) | body `{note?, next_review_date?}` → `{ok, id}` |

### 3b. Contract deltas (needed but not in the baseline — BUILD BACKEND-FIRST, only if §9 approves)

| kind | Endpoint / code (current → intended) | Decision | Why this page needs it |
|------|--------------------------------------|----------|------------------------|
| rename | `GET /review/centre` → **`GET /review`** | **D-030 (ND-2)** | API-CONTRACT delta not yet applied; retire "Review Centre" |
| reshape (values) | `review.py` thresholds → **`_RUNWAY_LOW_MONTHS=3`, `_GOAL_SOON_DAYS=180`** + **add `_OTHER_CLASS_OVERUSE_PCT=10%`** signal | **D-084/D-087 (ND-1)** | code serves 6/90 + lacks the over-use signal; PRODUCT-SPEC §5 records the divergence |

**⚠ Verify-first divergence flags (§9, not §3b guesses).** **(ND-1)** the served threshold VALUES + a
served SIGNAL diverge from the owner's decisions (D-084/D-087) — a real behavior gap, caught by reading
the constants, not assumed. **(ND-2)** the D-030 rename is unapplied. Any approved delta regenerates
`API-CONTRACT.json` + `docs/openapi.json` same commit (`make api-contract-check`); the threshold change
is a **backend value edit + its test**, not a shape change.

---

## 4. COMPONENTS

*Source: DESIGN-SYSTEM.md §5 (ratified) + §3 (templates). Ratified only; a missing affordance is a §9
amendment request. Data-wired to real endpoints.*

| Ratified component | Role on this page | Data source (real endpoint) | Not exercised at kitchen-sink |
|--------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **PageHeader** | H1 "Review" + subtitle + actions (Mark-reviewed) | — | a primary action |
| **ReviewCard** (Verdict) | section-verdict summary strip (its designed "canonical body on Review" role) | `/review/centre.sections` / `attention` | items-as-sections with per-area link (ND-7) |
| **DataTable** | the **attention list** (area · title · severity · link) + **review history** | `/review/centre.attention`, `/review/history` | severity column; area→canonical-page links |
| **Dialog + TextInput + DateInput** | **Mark-reviewed** (note + next-review date, `[S]`) | `/review/log` | a compose-inputs dialog (not `ConfirmDialog` — it needs fields) |
| **Segmented** | (optional) filter attention by severity / section | client filter | severity/section filter |
| **EmptyState** | "Nothing needs a look right now." (served) · reader error | reader shapes | the served honest empty |
| **Skeleton** | per-card progressive loading | — | header + attention + history cards |
| **GlossaryTerm** | `[Help]` on **Review** (+ severity? ND-11) | GLOSSARY | the Review definition |

**Affordances the ratified inventory may lack (amendment — resolve in §9 before build):**
- **Severity chip (ND-4).** Served severity ∈ {`review`, `info`} must render as a **labelled chip** (not
  the raw enum key — copy hygiene). Pricing Health hand-rolled a page-local `ph__chip`; confirm a
  page-local chip suffices or a ratified **severity chip** is a §5 amendment.
- **Per-section verdict strip (ND-7).** `review_centre.sections` is **raw section data** (counts/pcts),
  not verdicts; the verdict (ok/attention/info) is a **display grouping** of the attention items by
  `area` (never a recompute). Confirm `ReviewCard` (items-as-sections) covers it, or a small strip is a
  §5 note.

**Component usage rules the build must honour (template §4):**
- **Attention items are served display strings** — render `title`/`area`/`severity` verbatim (map the
  enum severity to a label, never show `"review"`/`"info"` raw). No frontend money math.
- **Per-signal resilience is honest (D-059):** one failing signal never breaks the feed (the reader
  guards each; the page must not assume all signals present).
- **Mark-reviewed is `require_auth`** (`[S]`); reporting-only copy is protected ("reporting only, not
  advice or a required action").
- **Cards LAYERED (D-100); scroll = content only, header outside (D-101); single vertical scroll region**
  (§12mk1-1). **Progressive per-card loading.**

**Tables — dataset-size posture (D-094):** the **attention list** is **bounded** (one row per fired
signal — tens at most) → client-side sort/filter fine. **History** is **append-only** but the reader
caps at `limit=24` (bounded window) → client-side over the loaded window; a "load more"/full history is
**not** a v2 need (record a revisit threshold if it grows).

---

## 5. VOCABULARIES

*Source: MASTER-DATA.md + served data.*

| Field on this page | Vocabulary / source | Fixed / served | Ref |
|--------------------|---------------------|----------------|-----|
| **severity** | served on each attention item — **{`review`, `info`}** (only two emitted, §10) | **served** — **NOT in GLOSSARY/MASTER-DATA** (ND-4/ND-11 terminology gap) | §10; `review.py` |
| **area / section** | served `area` (policy · data · liquidity · goals · obligations · insurance · estate · runway · corporate · ok) | **served** display keys → map to a canonical-page link (ND-7); render label verbatim | §10 |
| **note / next-review date** | user input on Mark-reviewed | user data (free-text `note`, ISO `next_review_date`) | §10 |

All severity/area/verdict labels are **served display strings** (D-005) — render verbatim; **never
render the raw enum key** (`review`/`info`) in a user string (copy hygiene).

---

## 6. DECISIONS IN FORCE

| Decision | What it forbids / requires on this page |
|----------|------------------------------------------|
| **D-038** | Review **canonical** for verdicts + attention; **Home / Net worth show a `ReviewCard` summary-with-link** (no figure Review doesn't own); provenance/confidence link to Pricing Health. |
| **D-059** | Every threshold is a **named constant with a one-line rationale** (table in §2); **per-signal try/except resilience** — one failing signal never breaks the feed. |
| **D-030** | The label is **"Review"** — **"Review Centre" / "Needs a look" (as a label) / "What needs attention" are RETIRED** (GLOSSARY deprecated table). **"what needs a look" allowed only as body copy.** Endpoint rename `/review/centre → /review` (ND-2). |
| **D-084** | Owner-set defaults **`_RUNWAY_LOW_MONTHS = 3`, `_GOAL_SOON_DAYS = 180`** (the code still serves 6/90 — ND-1). |
| **D-087** | The `_OTHER_CLASS_OVERUSE_PCT = 10%` over-use signal is part of the set (**absent from code** — ND-1); `other` retained as the honest escape valve. |
| **D-091** | Incomplete-details signal is **severity `info`** (a low-priority nudge, **never a hard wall**). |
| **D-031 / P-1** | Served display values only; the summary count on ReviewCard and the page reconcile (ND-3). |
| **D-027 / Guarantee 3** | Every empty / "—" shows a **reason**; the served empty is **"Nothing needs a look right now."** (verbatim). Never fabricate a signal. |
| **D-005 / D-050** | Served vocab/labels (zero-copy); any export server-side. |
| **D-065 / P-7** | Review is **household** (readers take **no `entity_id`**, §10) — ND-12. |
| **R-15** | User-configurable thresholds are **ROADMAP (later)** — **no config UI now** (ND-9). |

---

## 7. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

- [ ] **Attention list (D-038):** the served `attention[]` renders (area · title · severity chip);
      each item **links to its canonical page** by `area` (ND-7); **no raw enum key** in any string.
- [ ] **Section verdicts (D-038):** a per-section verdict summary (ReviewCard or strip) — verdicts are
      the served reader's, never recomputed.
- [ ] **Empty state (Guarantee 3):** with no signals, the served **"Nothing needs a look right now."**
      shows (verbatim), never a fabricated item.
- [ ] **Per-signal resilience (D-059):** the page renders correctly when some signals are absent (one
      failing signal never blanks the feed).
- [ ] **Mark-reviewed (D-038):** a `[S]`-gated dialog records a `ReviewLog` with **note + next-review
      date**; **review history** renders (date · net worth · confidence · attention count · note).
- [ ] **Thresholds (D-059):** the named-constant table is the canonical reference (ND-9 = in-app or
      spec-only); reporting-only copy protected ("not advice or a required action").
- [ ] **P-1 reconciliation (ND-3):** the page's attention count **matches ReviewCard's** (by
      construction / shared reader) — acceptance demonstrates it.
- [ ] **Terms match GLOSSARY;** `[Help]` on **Review**; copy hygiene — no decision IDs / enum keys.
- [ ] **Both themes + densities;** interactive OPEN states (Mark-reviewed dialog, DateInput) in both.
- [ ] **Rendered layout + overflow:** 320/375/900/1366 both themes, **zero horizontal overflow** +
      **single vertical scroll region** (extend the suites to `/review`). Geometry fixes **fail-first**.

---

## 8. BUILD PHASES

*One commit per phase. Backend deltas FIRST. **Do not start until §9 clears.***

- **Phase 0 — Contract/code deltas (only if §9 approves ND-1/ND-2):** **backend-first** — (a) the D-030
  rename `/review/centre → /review` (regenerate contract same commit); (b) the D-084/D-087 threshold +
  signal reconciliation in `review.py` **with a value test** (assert the served thresholds = the
  spec/D-084 values; the over-use signal fires at >10%). *(Skip only if §9 defers both.)*
- **Phase 0a — DESIGN-SYSTEM §5 amendment (only if ND-4 needs a ratified severity chip / verdict
  strip):** author PROPOSED, ratify at `/kitchen-sink`. *(Skip if a page-local chip + ReviewCard
  suffice.)*
- **Phase 1 — Page assembly:** compose ratified components over the reader; progressive per-card
  loading; header (section verdicts + last-review) + attention list (links by area) + Mark-reviewed +
  history + honest empty/error/resilience states.
- **Phase 2 — Tests:** component/render + acceptance (§7); the **P-1 reconciliation test** (page count ==
  ReviewCard count); a **per-signal-resilience test** (a missing signal doesn't blank the feed); extend
  the overflow + single-scroll suite to `/review`; drift/typecheck/lint/build green.
- **Phase 3a — Scripted pre-pass (GREEN before the walk):** drive the live page + real backend on seeded
  demo; assert populated attention list + section verdicts + Mark-reviewed round-trip + history + the
  empty state + honest guards; 0 overflow, single scroll region, 0 console errors; tooling guards
  demonstrated firing (§7/§8a). Geometry fixes **fail-first**.
- **Phase 3b — Owner acceptance walk (LIVE, judgment items only):** each finding → a numbered
  `page-review.md §*` entry, fixed + re-verified live. **Owner closes the page.**

---

## 9. NEEDS DECISION — RESOLVED (owner, one-pass, 2026-07-13)

All 12 items resolved in one pass. Each matched a §9 item by **number + topic**. The considered-options
record is retained beneath.

**Resolutions (owner, 2026-07-13):**
- **ND-1 — RECONCILE IN PHASE 0 (code catches up to ratified spec).** Apply to `review.py`:
  **`_RUNWAY_LOW_MONTHS = 3`, `_GOAL_SOON_DAYS = 180`** (D-084) and implement the **D-087 signal
  `_OTHER_CLASS_OVERUSE_PCT = 10`** — fires when `other`-classed holdings exceed 10% of gross assets,
  copy prompts proper reclassification, in its **OWN `try/except`** (D-059). No new decision (ratified
  D-084/D-087). Backend tests assert the new values + the signal firing + its **isolated failure path**;
  **fail-first** (each threshold/signal test shown RED on the old values before the edit).
- **ND-2 — APPLY the D-030 rename.** §3b delta **`GET /review/centre → GET /review`**, backend-first,
  regenerate `API-CONTRACT.json` + `docs/openapi.json` **same commit**, drift green. The page consumes
  **`/review`**. Grep the frontend for any `review/centre` reference.
- **ND-3 — (a) BY-CONSTRUCTION ACCEPTED.** Both endpoints derive from `review_report`; **`ReviewCard`
  stays on `/portfolio/review`**. An acceptance criterion **+ a test DEMONSTRATE (not prose)** that Net
  worth's ReviewCard attention count **==** the Review page's attention count, **live**.
- **ND-4 — DISPLAY, NEUTRAL.** Severity renders as a **served-verbatim string in a NEUTRAL chip** — **no
  semantic colour mapping** (semantic-only-colour rule; `info`/`review` are not gain/loss/fresh/stale).
  Severity also **orders items within a section** (higher first, as served). **No hardcoded severity
  list anywhere.**
- **ND-5 — (a).** **Mark-reviewed (`ReviewLog`) is the ONLY acknowledgement in v2.** Per-signal
  acknowledge/dismiss → **ROADMAP** as a new R-item (one line, noting it implies a **contract delta +
  state model**). **No ack affordance on items.**
- **ND-6 — YES, rotation-eligible** (D-044 explicit).
- **ND-7 — NAVIGATION MAP SANCTIONED.** A frontend **`area → route` map (navigation only, not vocabulary
  copy)**; every target is that area's **canonical page** (D-038). An **unrecognised area renders the
  item WITHOUT a link** — never a guessed route. Test: every served `area` maps or **honestly no-links**.
- **ND-8 — COMPOSE RATIFIED.** **`Dialog` + `TextInput` (note) + the ratified `DateInput`
  (next-review date)**, `[S]`-gated as served (`POST /review/log` `require_auth`). *(DateInput exists in
  the ratified §5.1 inventory → no §5 amendment; if it had not, STOP.)* Success → **toast + history
  refresh**.
- **ND-9 — SPEC-ONLY.** The D-059 table lives in the plan/spec, **never in UI** (constant names are
  implementation notes — copy hygiene). Plain-language **`[Help]` copy may describe** thresholds. **R-15
  parked; NO config UI.**
- **ND-10 — DECLINED** (not deferred): export is **Reports territory** (Net worth ND-14 / Pricing Health
  ND-12 precedent).
- **ND-11 — ADD PROPOSED:** GLOSSARY **"Mark reviewed"** + **"Severity"** (served values noted), ratify
  at the walk (News ND-9 pattern). Empty-state copy stays verbatim **"Nothing needs a look right now."**
  (allowed as body copy, D-030).
- **ND-12 — HOUSEHOLD-ONLY confirmed** (readers take no `entity_id`); logged for the Accounts milestone
  (no selector).

**Build sequence:** **Phase 0 backend-first** (ND-1 values + D-087 signal + ND-2 rename; contract regen
same commit; fail-first for the new threshold/signal tests) → **Phase 0a confirm-only** at
`/kitchen-sink` (ratified composition; DateInput exists — no §5 amendment) → **Phase 1** assembly
(worklist: verdict header + attention body + Mark-reviewed + history) → **Phase 2** (ND-3 reconciliation
test + ND-7 area-map test + `POST /review/log` request-body assertion + overflow/single-scroll) →
**Phase 3a** scripted pre-pass **GREEN**. STOP after the pre-pass report for the owner walk.

---

**Considered options (draft record — the resolutions above are authoritative).**

- **ND-1 — Threshold code↔spec divergence. ⚠ BEHAVIOR GAP (D-084/D-087).** `review.py` serves
  **`_RUNWAY_LOW_MONTHS = 6`** and **`_GOAL_SOON_DAYS = 90`**; **D-084** set them to **3 / 180**, and
  **D-087**'s `_OTHER_CLASS_OVERUSE_PCT = 10%` signal is **not in the code** (§10). PRODUCT-SPEC §5
  documents the divergence. Options: **(a)** apply D-084/D-087 to `review.py` NOW (this page's **Phase-0
  backend delta** — set 3/180, add the over-use signal, with a value test); **(b)** ship the page against
  the served values (6/90, no over-use), render the threshold table as the D-084/D-087 **intent** with a
  visible divergence note, and reconcile the code later. *(R-15 makes thresholds configurable later —
  no config UI now, ND-9.)* Owner picks — building Review is the natural place to close a documented
  owner-decision gap.
- **ND-2 — D-030 endpoint rename. ⚠ CONTRACT DELTA.** API-CONTRACT delta **`/review/centre → /review`**
  (retire "Review Centre") is **not applied**. Options: **(a)** apply it in **Phase 0** (backend-first,
  regenerate the contract) and read `/review`; **(b)** defer the rename, read `/review/centre` now (the
  user-facing label is already "Review" regardless). Confirm timing.
- **ND-3 — Which reader + P-1 single-fetch.** `/review/centre` (sections + attention, **unconsumed**)
  **reuses `review_report`**, the same reader `/portfolio/review` (ReviewCard) uses → the counts
  **reconcile by construction** (like Pricing Health ND-1). Options: **(a)** Review reads `/review/centre`
  (renamed `/review`); ReviewCard keeps `/portfolio/review`; acceptance + a test demonstrate the counts
  match; **(b)** a **shared client query** (the `staleCount` pattern) so ReviewCard + the page share one
  fetch site. Owner picks the P-1 posture. *(Both endpoints stay consumed after Review ships — neither
  is orphaned.)*
- **ND-4 — Severity display treatment + possible §5 amendment.** Served severity ∈ **{`review`, `info`}**
  (enum keys — not in GLOSSARY/MASTER-DATA). Options: **(a)** map to display labels + a **page-local
  severity chip** (the Pricing Health `ph__chip` precedent — no amendment); **(b)** a ratified
  **severity chip** component (§5 amendment). And the **section-verdict strip** (ReviewCard items-as-
  sections vs a small strip). Owner picks.
- **ND-5 — Acknowledgement / dismissal state.** **No per-signal ack exists in the served shapes** (§10 —
  verified, not assumed). Options: **(a)** **out of scope for v2** — **Mark-reviewed / `ReviewLog` is the
  only acknowledgement** (a state snapshot, not per-item dismissal); **(b)** a per-signal-ack **contract
  delta** this page owns; **(c)** **ROADMAP**. Recommend (a) — surface for the owner.
- **ND-6 — Rotation eligibility (D-044).** IA is not Review-specific. Confirm **YES** (any nav page is
  eligible; the user picks the set; pricing-health ND-10 precedent) — surfaced, not presumed.
- **ND-7 — Attention-item links + area model.** Each attention `area` (policy/data/liquidity/goals/
  obligations/insurance/estate/runway/corporate) should link to its **canonical page**. Confirm the
  `area → page` map (Policy · Pricing Health · Cash flow/Net worth · Scenarios · Insurance · Estate ·
  Holdings) and that a bare `ok`/empty item is a non-link. Rendering: a `DataTable` (area · title ·
  severity · link) vs `ReviewCard`.
- **ND-8 — Mark-reviewed composition + history.** `POST /review/log` (`require_auth`, `[S]`) takes
  `{note?, next_review_date?}`. Confirm the affordance: a **`Dialog` + `TextInput` (note) + `DateInput`
  (next-review date)** (not `ConfirmDialog` — it needs fields), `[S]`-gated; and **history** as a
  `DataTable` over `/review/history`.
- **ND-9 — Threshold table in-app or spec-only?** D-059's canonical home is **this spec** (the table is
  in §2). Confirm whether the page **renders** the table as an in-app "why these thresholds" reference,
  or it stays **spec-only**. **No config UI** (R-15 later).
- **ND-10 — Export posture.** Expect **DECLINED** (Reports territory, like pricing-health ND-12) — but an
  owner call. Confirm no CSV here.
- **ND-11 — Terminology / GLOSSARY.** **"Review"** is a GLOSSARY term (`[Help]`). Do the **severity
  values** ("review"/"info") need a GLOSSARY entry + display label, and does "severity" get `[Help]`?
  Confirm which terms are user-shown (no raw enum keys).
- **ND-12 — Entity scope (D-065).** Review readers take **no `entity_id`** (household, §10) — confirm;
  log for the Accounts milestone (pricing-health ND-11 precedent).

**Lower-risk confirms (owner ratifies with the above):** served labels throughout (D-005); Mark-reviewed
`[S]`-gated; reporting-only copy protected (D-038/Guarantee); the empty message verbatim (D-027).

## 10. VERIFY-FIRST FINDINGS (2026-07-13) — read before assuming shapes (D-019 + audit guards, §13a)

Ran the read-what-the-engine-serves pass — **and audited each reader's honesty guards, not just its
shape** — before drafting §3/§4/§5. **No shape was assumed; gaps went to §9, not §3b.**

| Item | What the engine actually serves / guards | Source |
|------|-----------------------------------------|--------|
| Review feed | `GET /portfolio/review` → `{as_of, count, items:[{area,title,severity}], disclaimer}`; `count` = # of `severity=="review"` items; disclaimer "Items to review — reporting only, not advice or a required action." | `portfolio.py:898`, `review.py:42/197` |
| Review centre | `GET /review/centre` → `{base_currency, net_worth, sections:{trust,policy,liquidity,goals,changed}, attention, attention_count, last_review, disclaimer}`; **`attention` = `review_report.items`, `attention_count` = `review_report.count`** (⇒ by-construction reconciliation, ND-3) | `portfolio.py:906`, `review.py:227/273` |
| Item shape | `_item(area,title,severity="review")` → `{area,title,severity}` — **no ack/dismiss field** (ND-5) | `review.py:38` |
| **Severity values** | **only two emitted: `review` (default) and `info`** (D-091 incomplete-details; the empty "ok" item) — no high/warn/critical | `review.py:38/166/195` |
| Areas | policy · data · liquidity · goals · obligations · insurance · estate · runway · corporate · ok | `review.py:53–195` |
| Empty state | `_item("ok", "Nothing needs a look right now.", severity="info")` — **verbatim** | `review.py:195` |
| **Per-signal resilience (D-059)** | **each signal block is wrapped in its own `try/except Exception: pass`** (policy, confidence/stale, liquidity, goals, obligations, insurance, estate, runway, corporate, incomplete-details, misplaced-expense) — one failing signal never breaks the feed. **Guard verified per-signal, not just overall.** | `review.py:48–192` |
| **⚠ Thresholds (code ≠ spec)** | code: `_RUNWAY_LOW_MONTHS = 6`, `_GOAL_SOON_DAYS = 90`; **D-084 = 3 / 180**; **`_OTHER_CLASS_OVERUSE_PCT` (D-087) is ABSENT from code**; PRODUCT-SPEC §5 records the divergence (ND-1) | `review.py:25–31`, PRODUCT-SPEC §5:141/160 |
| **⚠ D-030 rename unapplied** | endpoint is `/review/centre`, not `/review`; API-CONTRACT delta rows it (ND-2) | `portfolio.py:906`, API-CONTRACT.md:79 |
| History | `GET /review/history` → `{history:[{id,reviewed_at,days_ago,net_worth,base_currency,confidence,drift_flags,attention_count,note,next_review_date}]}` (reader caps `limit=24`) | `portfolio.py:914`, `review.py:298` |
| Mark-reviewed | `POST /review/log` (**`require_auth`**) body `{note?, next_review_date?}` → `{ok, id}`; records a `ReviewLog` snapshot | `portfolio.py:926`, `review.py:280` |
| Reader ↔ ReviewCard | **`ReviewCard` (Home/Net worth) consumes `/portfolio/review`** (`getReview`, `ReviewResp{as_of,count,items}`); **`/review/centre` is currently UNCONSUMED** (no Review page yet) | `frontend/api/net-worth.ts:88`, `routes/NetWorth.tsx:308` |
| Verdict mapping | `ReviewCard` `Verdict = "ok"｜"attention"｜"info"`; Net worth maps `severity==="review" → "attention"`; the component "reuses the Review reader's verdicts — never computes its own" | `components/ui/ReviewCard.tsx:6`, `NetWorth.tsx:62` |
| Entity scope | `review_report`/`review_centre`/`review_history`/`record_review` take **no `entity_id`** (household) — ND-12 | `review.py:42/227/280/298` |

**Owner sign-off surface (all in §9):** ND-1 (threshold divergence — the headline reconciliation), ND-2
(D-030 rename timing), ND-3 (reader + P-1 single-fetch), ND-4 (severity chip / §5), ND-5 (acknowledgement
scope), plus ND-6/7/8/9/10/11/12. **No build until the owner resolves §9.**

---

## 11. BUILD RECORD — Phases 0/0a/1/2/3a DONE; Phase-3b (owner walk) PENDING (2026-07-13)

- **Phase 0 — backend-first (ND-1 + ND-2), fail-first.** `review.py`: **`_RUNWAY_LOW_MONTHS = 3`,
  `_GOAL_SOON_DAYS = 180`** (D-084) + the **D-087 `_OTHER_CLASS_OVERUSE_PCT = 10`** signal (fires when
  `other`-class > 10% of gross; own `try/except` via a pure `_other_class_overuse_item` helper so the
  guard is **isolated-testable**, D-059). **D-030 rename** `/review/centre → /review` (contract
  regenerated same commit; drift green). Backend tests (constants + signal firing + **isolated failure
  path** + rename + **ND-3 reconciliation** `/portfolio/review.count == /review.attention_count`) were
  shown **RED on the old values** (fail-first), then green. **PRODUCT-SPEC §5 divergence note closed**
  (code now matches spec). **Backend 499 → 501** (+ the reconciliation + rename fixes).
- **Phase 0a — confirm-only.** The composition is all ratified (PageHeader · ReviewCard-precedent ·
  DataTable · Dialog + TextInput + **DateInput** · EmptyState · Skeleton · GlossaryTerm); the neutral
  **severity chip is page-local** (Pricing Health `ph__chip` precedent). **No §5 amendment** (DateInput
  exists — the ND-8 STOP-gate did not trip).
- **Phase 1 — assembly.** `routes/Review.tsx` (+`.css`) + `api/review.ts`, routed at `/review` (nav
  `built:true`). Worklist: **summary rail** (served net worth [→ Net worth], today's change, confidence,
  needs-a-look count, last-reviewed — **no client re-thresholding**) + **attention body** (`DataTable`:
  **neutral severity chip served-verbatim** ND-4, item, **area → canonical-page link** ND-7 with
  **unknown-area no-link**) **sorted review-first** + **review history** (last-24 legend) + **Mark-
  reviewed** (`Dialog` + `TextInput` + `DateInput`, `[S]`, toast + reload, ND-8). Honest empty (served
  `ok` → "Nothing needs a look right now."). **`[Help]` on Review**; GLOSSARY gains **Mark reviewed** +
  **Severity** (PROPOSED, ND-11).
- **Phase 2 — tests.** Backend **ND-3 reconciliation** test; `Review.test.tsx` (5): neutral chip +
  review-first sort (ND-4); area-map link + **unknown-area no-link** (ND-7); honest empty; **Mark-
  reviewed request-body assertion** (note + next-review date, ND-8/§7); history + legend. Overflow +
  single-scroll extended to `/review`. **153 unit + 117 Playwright.**
- **Phase 3a — pre-pass GREEN (first run).** `e2e/smoke/review-smoke.spec.ts` on live app + real
  backend: 5 attention rows · neutral chip verbatim · area links · **ND-3 reconciliation LIVE across
  BOTH surfaces** (`/portfolio/review.count` 4 == `/review.attention_count` 4 == Review-page DOM 4 ==
  Net-worth ReviewCard DOM 4) · **Mark-reviewed round-trip** (history 0 → 1) · `[Help]` · single scroll
  region · 0 overflow 320/375/900/1366 × both themes · **0 console errors**.

**Verification:** backend **501** · ruff · contract drift clean; frontend **153 unit + 117 Playwright** ·
typecheck/lint/tokens/build green; **live pre-pass GREEN**, 0 console errors. **STOP for the Phase-3b
owner walk (judgment items) — I do NOT self-certify.** Phase 3b: each finding → a numbered `§*` entry,
fail-first, geometry fixes fail-first; the **Mark reviewed + Severity GLOSSARY terms ratify at the walk**
(ND-11); owner closes the page.

---

## 12. PHASE-3b OWNER WALK — BATCH 1 (§12rv1-1..7) — ACCEPTED (owner, 2026-07-13)

**Owner live-re-verified Batch 1 and ACCEPTED the Review page (2026-07-13).** Ratified at the re-verify:
**§12rv1-1** Mark-reviewed icon; **§12rv1-4** severity colours (amber `--attention` for `Review`, neutral
for `Info`, neutral fallback); and the **ND-11 GLOSSARY terms Mark reviewed + Severity** flipped
PROPOSED → **RATIFIED 2026-07-13** (display-cased values recorded). CLOSE lines below.

Owner walk findings, each fail-first (owner-visible defect reproduced before the fix; every visual fix
ships its own pre-pass assertion in THIS batch). Two OWNER PICKs were taken before writing copy:
**§12rv1-3 → "Today" for 0, else "N days ago"**; **§12rv1-7 → "Attention"**.

- **§12rv1-1 — Mark-reviewed icon (PROPOSED, ratify at re-verify).** The page's one `[S]`-gated write
  gained a Lucide `CircleCheck` icon **beside its KEPT text label** (icon-only DECLINED — WCAG-AA /
  clarity baseline). Composition of the ratified `lf-btn--primary` (no new component); icon added to the
  ADR-0003 `icons.ts` vocabulary. **Pre-pass asserts** the Mark-reviewed button carries an `svg` AND the
  "Mark reviewed" text. Unit test: button keeps text + carries an icon.
  **CLOSE (owner, 2026-07-13): RATIFIED** — icon + kept text accepted at the live re-verify.
- **§12rv1-2 — Auto-mark-reviewed DECLINED → ROADMAP R-29.** Auto-recording a review on full-scroll +
  navigate-away declined for v2: (a) `POST /review/log` is `require_auth` `[S]` — a gated write must not
  fire silently; (b) a recorded review is a deliberate `ReviewLog` attestation (GLOSSARY), scroll-past is
  not review; (c) it would pollute Review history. Recorded as **ROADMAP R-29** ("implicit 'seen' state
  for Review attention items — a separate concept from Mark-reviewed; needs its own concept, auth
  posture, contract delta + state model, and a plan file"), distinct from per-signal ack/dismiss (ND-5).
  **No build now.**
- **§12rv1-3 — Relative-time copy (OWNER PICK: "Today"/"N days ago").** ONE shared day-granular formatter
  `relativeDays` (`format/time.ts`): `0 → "Today"`, `1 → "1 day ago"` (singular), `N → "N days ago"`.
  `relativeTime` (the ISO-timestamp formatter) routes its ≥24h branch through it — so the wording is
  identical everywhere it renders: the Review "Last reviewed" tile (was `"0d ago"`) **and** the NewsList
  meta line (§11-4, was `"Nd ago"`). Unit-tested 0/1/N pluralization + that `relativeTime`'s day branch
  reuses the shared copy. **Verified live: "Last reviewed: Today"** (days_ago 0).
- **§12rv1-4 — Severity semantic colour (ND-4 REVERSAL, PROPOSED, ratify at re-verify).** The neutral
  chip is reversed — severity **is** semantic. The chip maps the served value to a ratified tone with a
  **NEUTRAL fallback** for any unknown severity (no hardcoded severity list, no invented colour):
  **`Review` → the EXISTING `--attention` token** (`#b45309` / `#fbbf24`), **`Info` → neutral**. HARD
  GATE cleared — the ratified token set already carries `--attention` (no token amendment). **Pre-pass
  asserts** the chip carries `rv__chip--attention` for `Review` and `rv__chip--neutral` for `Info`; unit
  test asserts the tone class per severity. **Verified live** (amber "Review" chips, neutral "Info").
  **CLOSE (owner, 2026-07-13): RATIFIED** — `Review` → amber `--attention`, `Info` → neutral, neutral
  fallback for any unknown severity. The severity chip **stays PAGE-LOCAL** (`.rv__chip`, first
  occurrence of a *severity* chip; other pages' `*__chip` are status/staleness, a different concept) —
  extraction to a ratified component only at the **3rd recurrence** (centralization rule).
- **§12rv1-5 — Display casing served, backend-first (D-105 precedent).** `review.py` now serves
  **display-cased** `area`/`severity` labels (`Review`/`Info`, `Data`/`Liquidity`/`Estate`…) via a
  `_title` helper applied at the serialization boundary; the **count reconciliation (ND-3) is computed on
  the RAW severity BEFORE casing**, so it is unchanged. Contract **SHAPE unchanged** → no regen (drift
  clean). The frontend renders **verbatim** (D-005), **no CSS text-transform** (D-104); `AREA_ROUTE` /
  severity-order / `"ok"`-empty lookups + `NetWorth.reviewVerdict` case-normalise so nothing couples to
  casing. **Fail-first:** a dedicated backend test (`test_review_serves_display_cased_labels`) + the
  updated area/severity assertions (test_review / _centre / estate / insurance) are **RED on the pre-fix
  reader** (proven by git-stash: `1 failed`) and green after. **Net worth's ReviewCard reflects the fix**
  (same reader — verified live, reconciliation 4==4==4). PROPOSED GLOSSARY Severity value casing updated.
- **§12rv1-6 — History table: cap, no search/pagination.** The DataTable **worklist cap** (`--table-max-h`,
  60vh) already bounds both the attention and history tables — they scroll internally, the page keeps ONE
  scroll region. **Pre-pass asserts** the history `.lf-table__scroll` max-height is bounded (live: 432px).
  Search + pagination **DECLINED (not deferred):** the reader serves ≤24 rows — bounded, under the D-094
  client-side threshold; revisit only if the served cap changes. The honest "Showing the last 24 recorded
  reviews." legend is kept.
- **§12rv1-7 — Retired label "Needs a look" (D-030 defect) → OWNER PICK "Attention".** The summary tile
  label and the history column header used the retired label; both now read **"Attention"**
  (GLOSSARY-consistent). Frontend grep confirmed only those two label instances. **Body copy** ("What
  needs a look …" subtitle, "Review — what needs a look" section heading, ReviewCard's "N need a look")
  is sanctioned per D-030 — left as-is. **Fail-first:** a unit copy test asserts the retired label is
  gone + "Attention" present; the pre-pass's OWN stale `"Needs a look"` tile selector went RED on the
  rename (caught + fixed in the same batch).

**Verification (Batch 1):** backend **501** (incl. the new display-casing test) · ruff · contract drift
clean (shape unchanged); frontend **158 unit** (+5: relativeDays 0/1/N + relativeTime reuse, chip tone,
retired-label, Mark-reviewed icon, relative-time tile) + **117 Playwright** · typecheck/lint/tokens/build
green; **live pre-pass GREEN** — 5 attention rows
· `Review`+`rv__chip--attention` · reconciliation **4 == 4 == 4** (page DOM + Net-worth ReviewCard) ·
Mark-reviewed round-trip (history 0→2) · retired label gone + icon present · history cap 432px · single
scroll region · 0 overflow 320/375/900/1366 × both themes · **0 console errors**. ROADMAP R-29 added;
GLOSSARY Severity value casing updated. **Owner live-re-verified and ACCEPTED (2026-07-13)** — §12rv1-1
icon + §12rv1-4 colours + the ND-11 GLOSSARY terms (Mark reviewed + Severity) RATIFIED. Page CLOSED.

---

## 13. RETROSPECTIVE (Review page — CLOSED 2026-07-13)

**Strike-check first (claims verified against the running system, not the plan prose).** Nothing struck —
every §11/§12 claim reproduced at close:
- Backend **501 tests** collected/green (incl. the new `test_review_serves_display_cased_labels`);
  frontend **158 unit + 117 Playwright**; ruff + contract drift clean (§12rv1-5 was a value change, not a
  shape change — no regen, verified). Live pre-pass GREEN — reconciliation **4 == 4 == 4** re-observed;
  `/review` + `/portfolio/review` served display-cased `Review`/`Info`, `Data`/`Liquidity`/`Estate`.
- Fail-first for §12rv1-5 was **proven RED on the pre-fix reader** (git-stash: `1 failed`), not asserted.
- The D-030 rename test **discriminates by response shape** (JSON vs the SPA's HTML), not status — verified
  in `test_review_thresholds.py` (new path `application/json`; old path not JSON).

**Lessons (folded where they belong):**
1. **A ratified backend VALUE decision needs a same-batch code test — not just a spec edit.** D-084/D-087
   set the thresholds + over-use signal in the specs, but `review.py` kept serving the legacy 6/90 with no
   over-use signal; because a value change regenerates no contract, the drift was invisible until this
   page's **verify-first** pass caught it months later (ND-1). A spec edit alone lets code silently
   disagree. **Folded into `TEMPLATE-page-build.md` §3b** (value decision ⇒ fail-first pinning test in the
   same batch). PRODUCT-SPEC §5's stale "deliberately diverge from the code" trailer was **closed** at this
   close-out (the reconciliation was applied in Phase 0).
2. **Rename/removal tests must discriminate by SHAPE, not status.** The SPA serves `200` HTML for any
   unmatched path, so a retired endpoint still returns `200` — a status-code assertion would pass on a
   broken rename. Assert the **shape** (new = JSON of the intended shape; old = not JSON). **Folded into
   TEMPLATE §3b.**
3. **The scripted pre-pass writes pollute `ReviewLog` (tooling note, not a page defect).** Each pre-pass
   run records a real `Mark reviewed` snapshot (`prepass-*` note) — 2 rows accumulated on the dev instance.
   Cleared at close via the **seed-sanctioned reset** (`scripts/reset-demo-data.sh`; note its `DATA_DIR`
   **defaults to `$REPO_DIR/data` and does not read `.env`** — export `LEDGERFRAME_DATA_DIR` so the wipe
   and the reseed hit the same DB the app uses). Open tooling question for a future pass: the pre-pass
   should **tag + clean its own `ReviewLog` entries** (or run against a disposable DB) so it leaves no
   residue — a smoke-harness improvement, tracked as an 08-TECH-DEBT/tooling note, not a Review defect.

**What went well:** verify-first surfaced the D-084/D-087 code drift as a §9 item (not a walk finding);
the batch was small and one-pass (owner accepted at the first re-verify); every visual fix (icon, chip
tone, label) shipped its own pre-pass assertion in the same batch, and the pre-pass's own stale
`"Needs a look"` selector going RED on the rename proved the assertions actually bite. The severity chip
stayed **page-local** per the centralization rule (first severity-chip occurrence).

**Platform legacy from this page:** the shared **`relativeDays` / `relativeTime` day-copy** (`format/time.ts`,
now app-wide — Review + News), the **display-cased-at-the-boundary** reader pattern (serve labels, render
verbatim; logic case-normalises), and the two TEMPLATE §3b notes above. **No open Review blockers.**

---

## §12rv2-1 — attention-area vocabulary aligned to Cash flow (cross-page fix, 2026-07-15)

**A Cash-flow walk finding (page-cash-flow §12cf1-2) reached back into Review, and was fixed here** — the
StatusChip-migration precedent: when a page corrects a shared vocabulary, the correction propagates to every
page that shows it, in that page's own §-entry.

**The defect.** The obligation-due signal served its attention area as **`"obligations"`** → display-cased to
**"Obligations"**. But the signal iterates **all** obligation records, **income and expense alike** — so an
incoming *"Salary due in 20 days"* was grouped under **"Obligations"**. Calling an incoming salary an
*obligation* is the model's word, not the user's — the exact mislabel the Cash-flow walk had just fixed on the
canonical page. **Review reads the same records, so it must use the same word.**

**The fix (served-string, D-005).** `services/review.py` gains `_AREA_LABELS = {"obligations": "Income &
expenses"}`, applied at the display-casing boundary. **The internal `area` KEY is unchanged** (it drives the
ND-3 count reconciliation and stays a stable machine token); only the **served DISPLAY label** is overridden.
Propagates to **every** Review consumer (the page + the Home/Net-worth `ReviewCard`), because it is one reader.
**✅ STRING RATIFIED (owner, 2026-07-15) — CLOSED.** *"Income & expenses"* is the served attention-area label; the `_AREA_LABELS` boundary fix (internal key unchanged) and the ND-7 route correction (goals & income/expenses → Cash flow) stand. **Fail-first:** `test_review_groups_income_and_expenses_not_obligations` was **RED** on the old label
(`assert 'Income & expenses' in {'Data', … 'Obligations'}`).

**⚠ A second, adjacent defect found and fixed while here — reported, not buried.** The frontend `AREA_ROUTE`
mapped **both `goals` AND `obligations` to `/scenarios`** — an **ND-7 violation**: Scenarios owns *"the fixed
shock set, exposures, liquidity what-ifs"* (IA §5), **not** goals or obligations. Their **canonical home is
Cash flow** (IA §5, D-057), and ND-7 requires the link to be the *canonical* page. Both are re-pointed to
**`/cash-flow`** (and the obligations key becomes `"income & expenses"` to match the new served label). *This
was the identical bug class sitting one line away from the ruled fix; correcting it silently would have been
the wrong call, so it is called out for the owner's look.*
