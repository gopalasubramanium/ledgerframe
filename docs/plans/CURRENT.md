# CURRENT — Active Plan

The spec-generation sequence is defined in `docs/plans/spec-generation.md`
(ROADMAP pre-task + specs 1–6). This file tracks live status. The next session
starts from files, not memory.

## DONE

- **ROADMAP.md** (repo root) — all 14 parked items (R-1..R-14) extracted from
  DECISIONS.md, historical-FX merged (D-020 + D-076), header rule stated
  (nothing built without a plan file in `docs/plans/`). SaaS/PaaS (D-001)
  recorded as ADR-note, not a ROADMAP item.
- **docs/specs/GLOSSARY.md** — canonical term definitions; Deprecated-terms
  table (term → replacement → decision ID); Net worth formula; both movers
  pairs with the which-list rule; three-layer freshness structure; Source /
  Provider / Routing split; Product Guarantees block verbatim.
- **docs/specs/MASTER-DATA.md** — D-005 hybrid architecture (fixed vocabs via
  /refdata + DB CHECK vs user-extensible masters via DB tables, frontend zero
  copies); every fully-decided fixed vocabulary with complete seed values;
  currency master + FX-translatability rule; country/region model; institution,
  sector, tag masters + admin screens; migration dispositions. Blocked
  extractions (DEF-1..DEF-6) flagged, not guessed — app source absent from repo.
- **docs/specs/INFORMATION-ARCHITECTURE.md** — IA principles P-1..P-8 + Reports
  Pack exception verbatim; full page map (page/route/nav group/purpose); per-page
  canonical ownership tables (Owns / Summarises-with-reader / Links); navigation
  spec (D-043 groups, /snapshot redirect, /global removed, rotation eligibility);
  Home Simple/Full composition + ticker strip (D-046/D-047); feature-verdict
  appendix (Batches 7–9) + a killed/dropped safeguard appendix.
- **docs/specs/PRODUCT-SPEC.md** — what LedgerFrame is + who it's for; deployment
  posture (loopback default, LAN+PIN, VPN/Tailscale, SaaS out-of-scope-not-
  precluded); Product Guarantees verbatim; deliberate-semantics register (honesty
  features, architectural invariants, calculation honesty invariants incl.
  never-overwrite-NAV, honest-NULL FX, no-FK isolation); Review threshold
  named-constants table w/ rationale (D-059, values from 04 §13); scope principle
  (D-065/P-7); first-run checklist (D-045); Settings Privacy section (D-069).
- **docs/specs/DESIGN-BRIEF.md** — the Rebuild Playbook design brief, committed
  verbatim so the design source never leaves the repo again.
- **docs/specs/DESIGN-SYSTEM.md** — principles (numbers-first, semantic-only
  colour, typographic hierarchy, provenance-first); design tokens (slate palette
  light/dark, type scale 12/13/14/16/20/28, spacing, density comfortable/compact)
  — concrete values PROPOSED, to ratify at kitchen-sink review; four page
  templates + per-page mapping; full component inventory (props + usage rules);
  the compose-components hard rule; house-SVG chart policy + D-053 treemap/ECharts
  escape hatch; WCAG-AA / keyboard / reduced-motion / high-contrast a11y baseline.
- **INFORMATION-ARCHITECTURE.md amended** — Cash flow route resolved to
  `/cash-flow` (D-022 principle), `/planning` redirects; Needs-decision item
  cleared.
- **docs/specs/SECURITY-BASELINE.md** — threat model (D-001); D-004 gap
  disposition table (all 14 → fixed-in-v2 / accepted-with-ADR); PIN policy
  (D-002, access-lock-not-encryption + disk-encryption guidance); sudo helper
  install-time opt-in + allow-list + graceful degradation (D-003); normative AI
  validation contract (D-071) + visible fallback (D-070); ingress/egress
  symmetry (P-8/D-075/D-060); no-egress toggle semantics + Privacy state
  statement; positive privacy guarantees (D-016, no telemetry, hash-chained
  audit); CI hardening (dep pinning/CVE, durable rate limiter, CORS assertion);
  server-side export sanitisation (D-050); preserved baseline measures.

**All six specs in `spec-generation.md` are now written** (GLOSSARY, MASTER-DATA,
INFORMATION-ARCHITECTURE, PRODUCT-SPEC, DESIGN-SYSTEM, SECURITY-BASELINE) plus
ROADMAP.md and DESIGN-BRIEF.md.

## IN-PROGRESS

- (none)

## NEXT

1. **DEF backfill session** — once the app source is available, fill
   MASTER-DATA §2/§3/§6 (DEF-1..DEF-6), reconcile the three Review constant
   names (DEF-7) against `services/review.py`, and reconcile the sudo action
   allow-list against `app/api/v1/routes/system.py` (SECURITY-BASELINE §4).
2. **Kitchen-sink review** — ratify the PROPOSED design tokens
   (DESIGN-SYSTEM §2) once the component library is built.

## Needs decision

- **App source not in repo → DEF-1..DEF-7 blocked (mechanical).** MASTER-DATA §9
  lists six vocabularies whose authoritative values live in service-layer code
  not committed here (currency union, asset_subclass, ACCOUNT_KINDS,
  POLICY_TYPES/FREQUENCIES, DOC_CATEGORIES/CONTACT_ROLES, sector seed). DEF-7
  adds three Review constant *names* (values already recovered, PRODUCT-SPEC §5).
  SECURITY-BASELINE §4 adds the sudo action allow-list (`system.py`). All to be
  handled together in the DEF backfill session. Not product decisions.
- **Design token ratification.** The PROPOSED palette/type/spacing/density values
  in DESIGN-SYSTEM §2 are working values until ratified at the kitchen-sink
  review; the UI/serif font choice may need an ADR if self-hosting adds a
  dependency. Not blocking.
- ~~Cash flow route~~ — **resolved**: `/cash-flow` canonical, `/planning`
  redirects (D-022 principle applied to D-056).
