# CURRENT — Active Plan

The spec-generation sequence is defined in `docs/plans/spec-generation.md`
(ROADMAP pre-task + specs 1–6). This file tracks live status. The next session
starts from files, not memory.

## DONE

- **ROADMAP.md** (repo root) — all 14 parked items (R-1..R-14) extracted from
  DECISIONS.md, historical-FX merged (D-020 + D-076), header rule stated
  (nothing built without a plan file in `docs/plans/`). SaaS/PaaS (D-001)
  recorded as ADR-note, not a ROADMAP item.
- **docs/specs/GLOSSARY.md** — canonical term definitions; Deprecated-terms
  table (term → replacement → decision ID); Net worth formula; both movers
  pairs with the which-list rule; three-layer freshness structure; Source /
  Provider / Routing split; Product Guarantees block verbatim.
- **docs/specs/MASTER-DATA.md** — D-005 hybrid architecture (fixed vocabs via
  /refdata + DB CHECK vs user-extensible masters via DB tables, frontend zero
  copies); every fully-decided fixed vocabulary with complete seed values;
  currency master + FX-translatability rule; country/region model; institution,
  sector, tag masters + admin screens; migration dispositions. (DEF backfill
  since completed — see below; only DEF-2/DEF-6 authoring items remain.)
- **docs/specs/INFORMATION-ARCHITECTURE.md** — IA principles P-1..P-8 + Reports
  Pack exception verbatim; full page map (page/route/nav group/purpose); per-page
  canonical ownership tables (Owns / Summarises-with-reader / Links); navigation
  spec (D-043 groups, /snapshot redirect, /global removed, rotation eligibility);
  Home Simple/Full composition + ticker strip (D-046/D-047); feature-verdict
  appendix (Batches 7–9) + a killed/dropped safeguard appendix.
- **docs/specs/PRODUCT-SPEC.md** — what LedgerFrame is + who it's for; deployment
  posture (loopback default, LAN+PIN, VPN/Tailscale, SaaS out-of-scope-not-
  precluded); Product Guarantees verbatim; deliberate-semantics register (honesty
  features, architectural invariants, calculation honesty invariants incl.
  never-overwrite-NAV, honest-NULL FX, no-FK isolation); Review threshold
  named-constants table w/ rationale (D-059, values from 04 §13); scope principle
  (D-065/P-7); first-run checklist (D-045); Settings Privacy section (D-069).
- **docs/specs/DESIGN-BRIEF.md** — the Rebuild Playbook design brief, committed
  verbatim so the design source never leaves the repo again.
- **docs/specs/DESIGN-SYSTEM.md** — principles (numbers-first, semantic-only
  colour, typographic hierarchy, provenance-first); design tokens (slate palette
  light/dark, type scale 12/13/14/16/20/28, spacing, density comfortable/compact)
  — concrete values PROPOSED, to ratify at kitchen-sink review; four page
  templates + per-page mapping; full component inventory (props + usage rules);
  the compose-components hard rule; house-SVG chart policy + D-053 treemap/ECharts
  escape hatch; WCAG-AA / keyboard / reduced-motion / high-contrast a11y baseline.
- **INFORMATION-ARCHITECTURE.md amended** — Cash flow route resolved to
  `/cash-flow` (D-022 principle), `/planning` redirects; Needs-decision item
  cleared.
- **docs/specs/SECURITY-BASELINE.md** — threat model (D-001); D-004 gap
  disposition table (all 14 → fixed-in-v2 / accepted-with-ADR); PIN policy
  (D-002, access-lock-not-encryption + disk-encryption guidance); sudo helper
  install-time opt-in + allow-list + graceful degradation (D-003); normative AI
  validation contract (D-071) + visible fallback (D-070); ingress/egress
  symmetry (P-8/D-075/D-060); no-egress toggle semantics + Privacy state
  statement; positive privacy guarantees (D-016, no telemetry, hash-chained
  audit); CI hardening (dep pinning/CVE, durable rate limiter, CORS assertion);
  server-side export sanitisation (D-050); preserved baseline measures.

**All six specs in `spec-generation.md` are now written** (GLOSSARY, MASTER-DATA,
INFORMATION-ARCHITECTURE, PRODUCT-SPEC, DESIGN-SYSTEM, SECURITY-BASELINE) plus
ROADMAP.md and DESIGN-BRIEF.md.

- **DEF backfill DONE** — extracted verbatim from the legacy v1 source
  (`~/Documents/github/LedgerFrame`, read-only reference; app source enters this
  repo later as its own milestone). Filled in place with file:line cites:
  - DEF-1 currency master seed — 22-code union, base-eligible 9 (`config.py:18`),
    +5 (`refdata.ts:8`), +8 (`PortfolioEditor.tsx:22`); FX-translatability noted
    as runtime-validated (no static list). MASTER-DATA §3.
  - DEF-3 `ACCOUNT_KINDS` (7, `accounts.py:24`); DEF-4 `POLICY_TYPES` (10) /
    `premium_frequency` (4, `insurance.py:23-25`); DEF-5 `DOC_CATEGORIES` (9) /
    `CONTACT_ROLES` (5, `estate.py:19-20`). MASTER-DATA §2.
  - DEF-7 Review constants reconciled against `review.py:25-30` — all values
    matched the audit; two proposed names corrected (`_INSURANCE_SOON_DAYS`,
    `_CORP_ACTION_RECENT_DAYS`). PRODUCT-SPEC §5.
  - Sudo allow-list — exact `_ADMIN_ACTIONS` set (`system.py:24-36`).
    SECURITY-BASELINE §4.
- **DEF-2 / DEF-6 AUTHORED** — the two remaining items were authored (PROPOSED,
  ratify at review), so §9 is now empty:
  - DEF-2 `asset_subclass` fixed vocab (6): `crypto, derivative, equity, etf,
    mutual_fund, reit`. Per-value table names each consumer — only `derivative`
    is read by the router (`router.py:131`); crypto/equity/mutual_fund are
    code-assigned display-only; etf/reit PROPOSED per D-009. bond/deposit/
    retirement deliberately excluded (their lanes route by asset_class, not
    subclass). MASTER-DATA §2.
  - DEF-6 sector master: 11 GICS sectors seeded (PROPOSED, user-extensible), with
    the `_SECTOR_MAP` 12→seed migration mapping — Technology→Information
    Technology; Crypto / Index-ETF / Commodities → no map (sector=null, no silent
    merge). MASTER-DATA §6.

- **docs/plans/REVIEW-GUIDE.md** — plain-language review companion for the
  project owner (accountant, non-developer). Reads standalone; organized by owner
  concern (promises/never-does · how money is counted · pages & v1 removals ·
  dropdown lists with full values · privacy/security · ROADMAP one page). Every
  item carries an in-practice example, a decision ID, and an Approve/Challenge
  checkbox. Opens with an ATTENTION shortlist (~11 items: DEF-2 etf/reit, DEF-6
  GICS seed + three-null migration, Review thresholds, FX/tax posture, insurance
  exclusion, currency seed, cost-basis fifo/average, region derivation, the two
  spec interpretations). Includes an auditor's "how the numbers can be trusted"
  section (extracted/standard/authored trust tiers + 3 file:line spot-checks) and
  a one-page sign-off summary. Reading aid only — specs stay authoritative.

- **Batch 12 (D-081–D-088) — review-challenge resolutions** — the owner's
  REVIEW-GUIDE challenges recorded as a DECISIONS.md addendum and folded into the
  affected specs:
  - **D-081** insurance cash value → visible **valued** line on Net worth,
    excluded from the headline total (amends D-039). GLOSSARY, IA, PRODUCT-SPEC §4a.
  - **D-082** non-equity `sector=null` shown as an explicit **"Not
    sector-classified (non-equity)"** bucket. MASTER-DATA §6, GLOSSARY, IA Portfolio.
  - **D-083** region expanded to **six buckets** (India/Singapore/US/Europe/APAC/
    Other) with a full listing-country membership table. MASTER-DATA §4, GLOSSARY.
  - **D-084** review defaults owner-set: `_RUNWAY_LOW_MONTHS = 3` (was 6),
    `_GOAL_SOON_DAYS = 180` (was 90); rest as audited. These two deliberately
    diverge from `review.py` — recorded in PRODUCT-SPEC §5 audit trail. ROADMAP R-15.
  - **D-085** classification guidance: `asset_class` = exposure, `asset_subclass`
    = wrapper; listed REIT = `property` + `reit`. MASTER-DATA §2, GLOSSARY.
  - **D-086** no annualized return below a minimum-history threshold; cumulative
    only; XIRR from threshold upward. GLOSSARY returns, PRODUCT-SPEC §4c.
  - **D-087** `other` retained as the honest escape valve + Review signal
    `_OTHER_CLASS_OVERUSE_PCT = 10%`. MASTER-DATA §2, PRODUCT-SPEC §5, IA Review.
  - **D-088** ROADMAP restructured — R-6/R-8/R-14 bundled as the v2.1 "accounting
    precision" theme; R-15 (user-configurable thresholds) added. ROADMAP.md.
  - Affirmed unchanged: A2 (11 GICS sectors), REVIEW-GUIDE §3.3 (v1 removals).
  - REVIEW-GUIDE annotated with **→ Resolved** lines throughout; Spot-check 1
    updated for the deliberate D-084 divergence.

- **Backend copy-in milestone — plan** at `docs/plans/backend-copy-in.md`
  (Phase A copy · Phase B prune · Phase C OpenAPI freeze; acceptance criteria per
  phase). Migration strategy ADR: `docs/adr/0001-keep-legacy-alembic-chain.md`.
- **Backend copy-in — PHASE A DONE (faithful copy, tests green).** Copied the v1
  backend from the read-only legacy source (`~/Documents/github/LedgerFrame`):
  `app/` (138 py + Alembic tree, 24 migrations, single head `d1e7a4c02f95`),
  `alembic.ini`, `tests/` (104 files), `pyproject.toml`, `.env.example`,
  `scripts/` (12 ops scripts), `systemd/` (4 units), Docker configs. Excluded:
  frontend, build artifacts, real `.env`, DB files, legacy docs/README, D-079
  transcripts. Env via **uv** (`python3-venv`/pip unavailable under PEP 668):
  `uv venv .venv` + `uv pip install -e '.[dev]'`.
  - **Mechanical fixes only** (recorded per CLAUDE.md): (a) authored a minimal v2
    `README.md` stub — required by `pyproject.toml`'s `readme=` for the editable
    install (v2's own, not legacy's); (b) extended `.gitignore` (Python/data/
    venv/caches); (c) regenerated `docs/openapi.json` from the copied app via the
    copied `scripts/gen_openapi.py` — the inherited `test_openapi_contract.py`
    reads that committed artifact, which lives in legacy `docs/` (deliberately not
    copied); regeneration is deterministic and byte-identical to legacy (121
    paths). No source file altered otherwise.
  - **Tests: `pytest -q` → 458 passed, 0 failed** (79.8s). Before the openapi.json
    regeneration: 456 passed, 2 failed (both the missing-artifact case above);
    after: fully green. No legacy behaviour changed.

- **Backend copy-in — PHASE B DONE (decision-driven prune).** Deleted exactly
  what DECISIONS retired, nothing more:
  - **Models** (`app/models/__init__.py`): `ProviderConfig` (D-014), `Note`
    (D-015), `AIConversation`/`AIMessage` (D-016), `DashboardConfig`/
    `DashboardRotationItem` (D-017), plus their references in `system.py`
    (`reset-data`) and `seed/demo.py` (default-dashboard seed + `_DEMO_PAGES`).
  - **D-080** dead code: `verify_token()`, the commented `_carry_forward`
    duplicate (live one kept), the no-op `account` fetch + `if account: pass` in
    `portfolio.py`.
  - **D-042**: no bare server-side `/global` route exists — nothing to remove
    (`/markets/global` is the kept Global-tab endpoint, D-051).
  - **Migration** `f9e1a2b3c4d5_drop_retired_tables` (on head `d1e7a4c02f95`):
    drops the six tables child-first, **data-guarded** (raises loudly if any
    holds rows), with a full `downgrade()`. Verified: single head; clean upgrade;
    guard aborts on a seeded row; downgrade/upgrade round-trip.
  - **Tests removed (pruned-code only):** `test_token_roundtrip`/`_expiry`/
    `_tampered_token_rejected` in `tests/unit/test_security.py` (they exercised
    the deleted `verify_token`); PIN tests kept.
  - **Suite: `pytest -q` → 455 passed, 0 failed** (was 458; −3 removed tests).
    OpenAPI unchanged; inherited contract test still matches.

- **Backend copy-in — PHASE C DONE (OpenAPI freeze).** Froze the inherited HTTP
  contract as the v2 baseline:
  - **`docs/specs/API-CONTRACT.json`** (OpenAPI 3.1, 121 paths) generated from
    the post-prune app, deterministic (sorted keys); `docs/openapi.json` mirrors
    it for the inherited contract test.
  - **`docs/specs/API-CONTRACT.md`** — baseline statement + **delta table** of
    endpoints the specs will add/rename/remove (each row a decision ID) + the
    same-commit update rule. Frontend-route redirects noted as not-API-paths.
  - **Drift check** `scripts/check_api_contract.py` + `make api-contract-check`
    (regenerate and fail on any diff). Verified: passes clean, fails on a
    synthetic injected path.
  - **Suite: 455 passed, 0 failed.**

**Backend copy-in milestone COMPLETE** (Phases A/B/C). See
`docs/plans/backend-copy-in.md` for the full record.

- **Frontend foundation milestone — plan + ADR.** Plan at
  `docs/plans/design-system-build.md` (Phase A scaffold · B tokens · C
  components · D kitchen-sink + ratification; acceptance criteria per phase;
  components only, no templates/pages this milestone). Stack recorded as
  **ADR-0002** (`docs/adr/0002-frontend-stack-react-vite.md`): React + TS + Vite
  from scratch, CSS custom properties as the single token source, no CSS
  framework/charting/webfont dependency without a further ADR.
- **Frontend foundation — PHASE A DONE (scaffold, all checks green).** `frontend/`
  app boots; `/health` probe via Vite dev proxy → backend (127.0.0.1:8321)
  showing ok+version / unreachable (verified end-to-end against the live
  backend); light→dark→system theme cycle (D-066) wired to the token layer via
  `<html data-theme>`, per-device localStorage (D-078), flash-free bootstrap.
  ESLint 9 + `tsc` + Vitest (3 tests). **Token drift check**
  (`frontend/scripts/check-design-tokens.mjs`, `npm run check:tokens`) fails on
  any raw hex/px in components outside the token layer — proven green clean and
  red on a deliberate violation. `npm run check` + `npm run build` pass. Minimal
  token slice committed; full DESIGN-SYSTEM §2 set is Phase B.

- **Frontend foundation — PHASE B DONE (tokens).** Full DESIGN-SYSTEM §2 token
  set in `frontend/src/theme/tokens.css`: colour (light/dark) + high-contrast
  override; type scale 12/13/14/16/20/28 + line-heights/weights + UI/serif
  fallback stacks (no webfont dependency, ADR-deferred); 4px spacing scale;
  radius/border/`--shadow-1`; density (comfortable/compact); motion duration
  collapsing to 0 when reduced. D-078 axes via `DisplayProvider` stamping
  resolved `data-density`/`data-contrast`/`data-motion` on `<html>`, per-device
  localStorage, following `prefers-contrast`/`prefers-reduced-motion` on
  `system`. Tabular figures proven live. All PROPOSED per §2.6. Checks + build
  green.

- **Frontend foundation — PHASE C DONE (components).** Full DESIGN-SYSTEM §5
  inventory in `frontend/src/components/ui/` (19 named + `Sparkline` + a generic
  `Select`): inputs (Money/Quantity/Percent/Date/InstrumentPicker/MasterSelect),
  data display (DataTable, TrendStat, AllocationDonut, PriceChart, Treemap,
  QuoteCardRow, TickerStrip), provenance (ProvenanceBadge, StalenessChip),
  structure (PageHeader, EmptyState, ReviewCard, GlossaryTerm). No raw
  `<input>`/`<select>`; MasterSelect resolves categoricals through a mock
  `/refdata` registry (verbatim MASTER-DATA seeds); money from backend decimal
  strings via display-only formatters (no frontend math); house-SVG charts only
  (squarified treemap, no ECharts — D-053). Mock fixtures cover negatives, long
  names, multi-currency, and stale/low-confidence/manual/unavailable provenance.
  22 tests; check + build green; drift clean. Two under-specified points flagged
  (segment palette; generic Select) in `docs/plans/design-system-build.md` and
  Needs decision below.

- **Frontend foundation — PHASE D DONE (kitchen sink + ratification).**
  `/kitchen-sink` route renders every §5 component in every meaningful state
  (loading/empty/error/stale/negative/low-confidence/long-RTL labels), both
  themes + both densities switchable live, organized for a ratification
  walk-through; a **token swatch board** labels palette/type/spacing with token
  names. `docs/plans/RATIFICATION.md` lists every PROPOSED token group + every
  component with checkboxes + the two open interpretations + a sign-off block.
  Visually verified in headless Chromium (treemap-label distortion found and
  fixed). 23 tests; check + build green.

**Frontend foundation milestone COMPLETE** (Phases A/B/C/D). See
`docs/plans/design-system-build.md` for the full record. The four page templates
(overview/entity-detail/worklist/settings) and real pages remain deliberately
out of scope — components only.

- **Design-system RATIFIED (2026-07-10, approved with 3 amendments).** Owner
  ratified §2 tokens + the full component inventory at the kitchen sink. Applied
  through the token layer (drift green, AA re-verified both themes): (1) **accent**
  cobalt→slate-navy (`#24476f` / `#6f9fd4`); (2) **light gain** desaturated ~15%
  (`#15803d`→`#1e763e`; dark unchanged); (3) **treemap** flat fills → a continuous
  **magnitude scale** (`--treemap-base` + data-driven `color-mix` intensity; soft
  tint near 0%, full at ≥5%) with a scale legend on the kitchen sink. The 5-tone
  segment palette and `ui/Select` ratified as implemented. DESIGN-SYSTEM §2
  PROPOSED markers flipped to ratified. Record: `docs/plans/RATIFICATION.md`.

- **Page-build framework — plan + first page (PLAN ONLY, not built).**
  - **`docs/plans/TEMPLATE-page-build.md`** — the reusable plan template every
    page build follows. Forces, before any code: IDENTITY · OWNERSHIP TABLE ·
    API SURFACE (with a backend-first *contract delta* list) · COMPONENTS (ratified
    only; new components forbidden without a DESIGN-SYSTEM amendment) ·
    VOCABULARIES · DECISIONS IN FORCE · ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (incl. honesty +
    theme/density) · BUILD PHASES (deltas first, one commit/phase) · NEEDS
    DECISION (surfaced pre-build). Each section is *derived from the specs with a
    section reference*, never re-invented.
  - **`docs/plans/page-holdings.md`** — first instantiation (Holdings, the
    canonical data-entry page: D-012 picker · D-019 merger · D-012 import review
    queue · D-049 soft-delete/undo/one-Add-flow · D-050 server-side CSV). Fully
    filled from the specs. **Not built — owner reviews first.** Its NEEDS DECISION
    surfaces real pre-build blockers (below).

- **BUG FIX — holdings/CSV/summary 500 (blocking, 2026-07-10).** The valuation
  reader (`value_portfolio`, shared by holdings, holdings.csv, summary) could
  **crash the whole reader** on one problematic holding. Could **not** reproduce
  the owner's exact trigger (demo data + a full Add-flow replay both return 200),
  so fixed the **class**: (1) confirmed + fixed a concrete crash —
  `fx.convert(amount, None, base)` did `None.upper()` → `AttributeError`; guarded
  `fx.convert` against a falsy currency + gave `value_portfolio`'s `native_ccy` a
  base-currency fallback; (2) **per-holding resilience** — extracted
  `_value_one_holding`; any per-holding failure now degrades to an **Unavailable**
  row (0, unpriced — honest, not fabricated) and is **logged** (`holding id/label
  + reason`), so the reader never 500s and the root cause is diagnosable from the
  logs. 460 backend tests (+1 resilience regression); ruff clean; demo + replay
  verified 200. **Owner: if it still misbehaves, the warning log now names the
  offending holding + reason — share that line to fix the root cause at source.**

- **Holdings final-batch (owner greenlight, 2026-07-10).**
  - **500 CLOSED** — environmental (backend wasn't running); resilience +
    fx/native_ccy guards stay as defence-in-depth (§9-24).
  - **Tags clipping fixed + row quick actions** — per-row actions moved to a
    compact **`RowMenu`** (⋯); Holdings: Details/Tags/Delete, Transactions:
    Edit(`TxnEditDialog`)/Delete; DataTable gains a **`truncate`** column option.
    No clipped headers / no mandatory h-scroll at laptop widths (§9-22).
  - **D-092** — Insurance signpost tile (navigates to `/insurance`, never
    branches the form; D-062) (§9-20).
  - **D-093** — editable import review grid (per-cell error highlighting, inline
    fix or exclude, Commit gated until all rows resolved; commit re-uploads a
    reconstructed CSV) (§9-21).
  - **Purge polish** — new `GET /portfolio/deleted-count` (contract +1 → 124
    paths); purge control hidden at zero, shows the count (§9-23).
  - **Dev ergonomics** — `make dev` / `scripts/dev.sh` runs backend + frontend
    together (creates a local dev `.env` on first run, never `/mnt`); README
    documents it.
  - 42 frontend + 460 backend tests; drift/ruff/lint/typecheck/build green.
  - **PROPOSED for ratification:** D-090 (matrix, now with the import-bypass
    clause) + D-091 (per-class fields) in MASTER-DATA §10/§11.

## HOLDINGS — DONE ✅ (page ACCEPTED at the true final pass, 2026-07-10)

**`/holdings` is complete and owner-accepted.** All ten acceptance/confirmation
walks are resolved (page-holdings.md §9-1..39); the entries below are the walk log,
kept as the build history. Everything that page-holdings.md surfaced is shipped and
verified (the last two — D-097 class-aware picker and the popover overlay rule —
were verified live in Chromium). The Holdings page is the reference instantiation of
`TEMPLATE-page-build.md`; the retrospective folding its lessons back into the
template is the next task. No open Holdings blockers remain.

## IN-PROGRESS (Holdings walk log — page now DONE above)

- **Holdings acceptance walk — 4 findings fixed 2026-07-10.** (page-holdings.md §9-9..11)
  - **Select dark-popup bug** — native `<select>`/date popups now follow the
    theme via `color-scheme` + tokenized `option` colours in the ui input layer;
    "open in both themes" specimen added to `/kitchen-sink`; TEMPLATE §7 now
    requires manual open-state verification in both themes.
  - **Split/bonus fields** (D-019 way, no engine change) — verified the pinned
    §4.3 vectors, then gave each purpose-labelled fields: **split → "Split
    ratio"** (→ price, qty 0); **bonus → "Bonus units"** (→ quantity, zero cost,
    no price).
  - **Terminology** — "Total value" (retired D-021) → **"Net worth"** on the
    summary (net-of-liabilities), as a linked P-1 summary; frontend grep found no
    other deprecated terms.
  - Still pending owner: ratify **`TextInput`** (§9-8) at the Holdings look.
  - 36 frontend tests + build green; drift/typecheck/lint clean.

- **Holdings acceptance walk #2 — 4 Add-flow findings fixed 2026-07-10; no engine
  change** (page-holdings.md §9-12..15). Engine semantics verified first, then
  forms reshaped:
  - **Dividend / Interest** → single **"Amount received"** field (verified
    total-cash, not per-share, in `statements_report`/`compute_fifo`); mapped
    quantity 1 × price so stored `amount` == the entered value. Interest
    instrument optional.
  - **Fee** → single **"Amount"** with help text; routes to **Recorded fees** via
    the fee-type `amount` (never the `fees` field → no D-048 double-count), never
    cost basis (no `compute_fifo` branch). GLOSSARY gains **"Fee (recorded)"**.
  - **Fractional quantities** audited end-to-end — DB `DecimalText`, engine
    `Decimal`, API `float`, frontend free-decimal: **supported, no integer-only
    layer, no fix needed**. Optional non-blocking NEEDS DECISION: Decimal-string
    API for sub-float crypto exactness (parked-worthy).
  - 38 frontend tests + build green; backend 459 unchanged; ruff clean.

- **D-089 — Type-first Add flow (owner, 2026-07-10; recorded in DECISIONS.md).**
  The Add entry step is now a **grid of asset-type tiles in user vocabulary**
  (Stocks & ETFs · Mutual fund · Crypto · Cash · Fixed deposit · Bond · Property ·
  Retirement · Private · Liability · Other), each with a plain-language subtitle;
  choosing a tile routes to the **existing single D-049 flow** with branch +
  fields preselected. Listed/Manual mechanism tabs are no longer the front door;
  the flow underneath is unchanged. Tile→branch/asset-class from MASTER-DATA
  `AssetClass` (no new vocabulary); Listed tiles classify new instruments
  (crypto→CoinGecko, mutual_fund→AMFI). **No backend/engine/contract change.**
  Verified in headless Chromium; 39 frontend tests + build green (also fixed a
  ToastProvider timer leak on unmount). page-holdings §9-16.

- **D-090 / D-091 RATIFIED + SHIPPED, D-094 recorded (owner, 2026-07-10).**
  page-holdings §9-25/26; DECISIONS.md D-090/D-091/D-094.
  - **D-090 (RATIFIED, ETF-Bonus amendment) — shipped.** Matrix served at
    `GET /refdata/txn-applicability` (frontend zero-copy D-005; contract +1 →
    **125 paths**). Listed Type dropdown filters by class (`MasterSelect` gains an
    `include` subset prop); Manual branch gains a **"Record transaction"** sub-mode
    (interest/deposit/withdrawal/fee/transfer; buy/sell excluded) posting an
    instrument-less cash-flow txn via the existing endpoint. **No engine change.**
    MASTER-DATA §10 → RATIFIED (ETF Bonus ✓).
  - **D-091 (RATIFIED) — shipped.** `_META_KEYS` gains property `cost` + private
    `round`; Manual Add form prompts the per-class OPTIONAL-PROMPTED fields
    (`MANUAL_META_FIELDS`) → `meta`. Review signal `_INCOMPLETE_DETAILS_MIN = 1`
    (severity `info`) — *"N holdings have incomplete details"*, never a hard wall
    (PRODUCT-SPEC §5). MASTER-DATA §11 → RATIFIED.
  - **D-094 (recorded + both tables done).** Audit: `DataTable` is presentational;
    the page wired neither sort nor filter (raw API order; txns capped at 500).
    **Holdings** → client-side sort/filter **shipped** (bounded dataset; explicit
    assumption + ~1,000-position revisit threshold). **Transactions** →
    **server-side shipped** (own commit): `GET /portfolio/transactions` gains
    sort/dir/filter/offset/limit + **`total`**; sort+filter over the full dataset,
    windowed (100/page), UI states *"Showing X–Y of Z"* with Prev/Next + debounced
    filter — **500-row silent cap gone**; numeric columns cast for value-sort; CSV
    export stays full-dataset (D-050). Worklist rule added to
    `TEMPLATE-page-build.md` §4/§7.
  - **Commit 1** (D-090/D-091/D-094-record + Holdings client-side): **463 backend**
    (+3) + **45 frontend** (+3). **Commit 2** (transactions server-side): **467
    backend** (+4 paging) + **46 frontend** (+1). ruff/contract-drift/tokens/lint/
    typecheck/build green throughout.

- **Final-walk findings #7 — CSV round-trip bug + layout (owner, 2026-07-10;
  NOT yet committed — owner re-verifies first).** page-holdings §9-27..30;
  DECISIONS.md D-095.
  - **Round-trip bug (D-095) FIXED.** The Holdings **Export** was a positions
    **snapshot** while **Import** ingests a transactions **ledger** → every row
    failed, symbols "(none)". A snapshot can't round-trip without fabricating trade
    dates, so the lossless pair is a **transactions export ⇄ transactions import**:
    new `GET /portfolio/transactions.csv` (columns == `IMPORT_COLUMNS`; wired to the
    ledger Export; contract +1 → **126**); the importer now returns one honest
    `format_error` for a snapshot instead of 14 garbage rows. **Permanent
    round-trip test** + rule in `TEMPLATE-page-build.md` §7.
  - **Import review grid** responsive (content-typed columns), dialog `size="xl"`.
  - **Add dialog** two-column form at desktop, dialog `size="lg"` — `Dialog` gains
    a **`size`** prop (§5.4 amendment).
  - **Holdings table** fits 1366px: Symbol+Name merged into one identity cell,
    Class → chip, Source → `StalenessChip`+tooltip; compact density one step denser.
  - **469 backend** (+2 round-trip) + **48 frontend** (+2) tests; all checks green.

- **Post-import + polish findings #8 (owner, 2026-07-10).** page-holdings §9-31..34.
  - **Import visibility (item 1)** — *not* a persistence bug (commit saves +
    rebuilds fine). Imported rows are historical-dated → they sank below the
    most-recent-first window. Fix: ledger gains an **`added`** (insertion-order)
    sort; **post-commit the ledger jumps to "recently added"** + toast says so.
  - **StalenessChip (item 2)** — fixed *"Stale · as of Stale cache"* (label passed
    as `asOf`) and the width. Holdings response now carries real **`price_ts`**;
    chip reads compact **"Stale · 08 Jul"** (full date in tooltip), just "Stale"
    when no timestamp; `nowrap`, no horizontal scroll.
  - **Table height (item 3)** — `DataTable` caps at **`60vh`** and scrolls
    internally (sticky header); page can't grow unboundedly. Template rule added.
  - **Tile order (item 4)** — **"Other"** moved to last, after Insurance.
  - **470 backend** (+1 recently-added) + **49 frontend** (+1 import-visibility)
    tests; ruff/contract-drift/tokens/lint/typecheck/build green.
  - **Committing this batch together with findings #7** (owner: "commit everything
    pending"). — committed `98f1dc2`.

- **Confirmation-pass findings #9 (owner, 2026-07-10) — verified with REAL flows.**
  page-holdings §9-35..37; DECISIONS.md D-096. **Not yet committed** (owner does one
  more confirmation pass first).
  - **Import "Imported 0" (item 1)** — diagnosed via a real browser + real-API flow:
    *not* a payload bug (committed CSV contains exactly the included rows, proven by
    a payload-guard test); cause is duplicate-skip. `Toast` gains a **`tone`**; a
    zero-import commit now shows a **warning** ("No rows were committed — …
    duplicates"), never success. Verified in Chromium (amber toast screenshot).
  - **Holdings table 1366px (item 2)** — verified by screenshots that it still
    overflowed (`1184 > 1110`, ⋯ clipped). Fix: **dropped the Price column** (it's
    "—" for manual holdings; Value is the decision figure; price → row Details). Now
    `overflowX: false` at 1366 & 1920, both themes; ⋯ fully visible.
  - **D-096 (item 3)** — Import dialog "Download template" → generated from the
    D-090 matrix (one row per class × permitted type; can't drift; self-importable).
    Verified in Chromium (downloads `ledgerframe-import-template.csv`).
  - **472 backend** (+2: template round-trip, duplicate-skip report) + **52 frontend**
    (+3: payload guard, warning toast, template button) tests; contract 126 paths,
    drift green; ruff/tokens/lint/typecheck/build green. — committed `af50f6c`.

- **Final findings #10 (owner, 2026-07-10) — picker + popover, verified LIVE.**
  page-holdings §9-38/39; DECISIONS.md D-097.
  - **D-097 class-aware picker** — was mock-backed & class-blind. New
    `GET /instruments/search?q=&asset_class=` (contract +1 → **127**) returns
    `existing`/`other_class`/`suggestions`; the picker takes the Add-flow class,
    filters existing by it, routes provider search (AMFI/CoinGecko/market), and
    shows cross-class matches as **navigate links, never selectable**. Verified in
    Chromium (mutual-fund add shows AAPL only as "Found in equity: AAPL →").
  - **Universal popover rule** — custom popovers portal to the viewport
    (`position:fixed` + max-height + internal scroll); the InstrumentPicker menu
    now portals to `document.body`. Verified in Chromium (`portaledOutsideDialog:
    true`, `dialogScroll: false`). Recorded in DESIGN-SYSTEM §6 + kitchen-sink
    open-inside-dialog case.
  - **474 backend** (+2 instruments-search) + **53 frontend** (+1 class-aware
    picker) tests; contract 127 paths, drift green; ruff/tokens/lint/typecheck/
    build green. **Committing now** (owner: "commit … then I do the true final pass").

- **D-090 / D-091 — PROPOSED spec tables (owner, 2026-07-10; SUPERSEDED — see the
  ratified+shipped entry above), + compact picker fixed now.**
  - **D-090 (MASTER-DATA §10, PROPOSED)** — AssetClass × TxnType applicability
    matrix; the Type dropdown will filter by class (form-level only, **engine
    unchanged**). Judgment calls flagged (crypto corporate actions off;
    retirement/liability interest).
  - **D-091 (MASTER-DATA §11, PROPOSED)** — per-class REQUIRED vs
    OPTIONAL-PROMPTED creation fields, seeded from the D-049 `_META_KEYS`
    whitelist. Verified present (FD rate/maturity, bond coupon/maturity, property
    address/valuation-date, retirement scheme, private company/ownership); gaps =
    property `cost`, private `round`. Incomplete details → a low-priority Review
    signal, never a hard wall.
  - **Compact type picker (done)** — all 11 tiles + Cancel now fit without
    scrolling on a laptop (3 cols verified in headless Chromium at 1366×768);
    presentational, independent of ratification.
  - Recorded: DECISIONS.md (D-090/D-091 PROPOSED); page-holdings §9-17/18/19.
    39 frontend tests + build green; no backend change.

- **Corporate-actions gap — RECORDED (owner-identified 2026-07-10; not built).**
  1. **ROADMAP R-7 enriched** into the v2.1 "accounting precision" theme:
     **de-merger / spin-off** (merger-in-reverse — cost-basis apportionment per
     approved ratio, holding-period carry, zero realised gain) **+ ticker/symbol
     rename**. Plan-file coverage spelled out (ratio user-input vs published
     reference, multi-instrument creation flow, FX acquisition-rate carry,
     provenance labelling). `ROADMAP.md` R-7 + v2.1 theme.
  2. **VERIFIED (this milestone):** editing an instrument's **name** preserves
     transaction history + price continuity — transactions/holdings/lots reference
     `instruments.id` (FK), identity is `(id_type, value)`. Recorded in GLOSSARY
     ("Ticker / name change"). The **symbol/ticker rename** is not yet exposed
     (`InstrumentPatch` lacks a symbol field) → added to ROADMAP R-7.
  3. **GLOSSARY entries added** (canon): **Rights issue** (= Buy at rights price),
     **Buyback** (= Sell at offer price) — existing types, correct cost basis, no
     special form; **De-merger / Spin-off** (R-7); **Ticker / name change**. The
     in-app **Help copy** task is queued for the Help/Holdings page plan (NEXT).

## DONE (Holdings page-build — all phases)

- **Holdings build COMPLETE (Phases 0a/0b/1/2, 2026-07-10).** See
  `docs/plans/page-holdings.md`.
  - **0a — §5 component amendment, RATIFIED** — Dialog/Drawer, ConfirmDialog+PIN,
    FileInput, Toast/Snackbar; `--scrim` token.
  - **0b — backend contract deltas** — `GET /refdata` (D-005, 22 vocabs),
    `GET /portfolio/holdings.csv` (D-050), `TransactionIn` merger reshape (D-019),
    typed `GET /portfolio/holdings` (§9-6). Contract regenerated (121→**123
    paths**); **459 backend tests**; ruff clean.
  - **1 — page assembly** — `/holdings` composes the ratified components:
    holdings table + linked P-1 summary header (→ Portfolio, D-023), transactions
    ledger with soft-delete + 10s undo Toast, one Add flow (listed/manual;
    merger = Absorbed-into + Ratio), import (FileInput→preview→commit), tags
    editor, purge [PIN], server-side Export (P-5). Vocab via `/refdata`
    (`RefdataProvider`; MasterSelect reads live values, registry is the offline
    fallback). Verified in headless Chromium against the live backend (real
    seeded data). Surfaced + built **`TextInput`** (§9-8, PROPOSED) for free-text
    label/tag fields.
  - **2 — tests** — `Holdings.test.tsx` (6, API-mocked). Frontend suite **35
    tests**; drift + typecheck + lint + build green.
  - **Follow-ups (non-blocking, in page-holdings §9):** InstrumentPicker→real
    instrument search (symbol entry works via the create path; merger-target
    id needs it); per-holding tags read-back; purge PIN→session-auth binding;
    `summary`/`import-preview` response typing.

## INSTRUMENT DETAIL — DONE ✅ (page ACCEPTED, Phase-3 walk complete, 2026-07-11)

**`/instrument/:symbol` is complete and owner-accepted** — the first **entity-detail**
template variant (`docs/plans/page-instrument-detail.md`). Phases 0/1/2 built +
Phase-3 acceptance walk resolved across three finding batches, all verified rendered:
- **Phase 0 (`2eb656b`)** contract deltas: holdings `?symbol=` scoped reader (ND-1),
  `/refdata` `source_override` (ND-3), typed `GET /instruments/{symbol}` (ND-4).
- **Phases 1/2 (`45c243a`)**: the page (scoped quote/identity/class-panel/house-SVG
  chart/position/ongoing-cost/news/edit); the **AI explainer is DEFERRED** to the
  AI-surfaces milestone (ND-2/ND-5; D-068 intact — page ships without it).
- **Walk batch 1 (`9e90b60`)**: D-098 symbol links, D-099 class-scoped ongoing cost,
  layout. **Batch 2 (`df60600`)**: served display labels (item 3b). **Batch 3
  (`61dfa41`)**: PriceChart amendment (RATIFIED). **Surfaces (`7cb8066`,`1271ce7`)**:
  D-100 layered cards, D-101 themed scrollbars + header-outside-scroll. **Refinements
  (`b374765`)**: canonical link in card header, header-owns-gutter. **Close-out**:
  the **MetaStrip** primitive (Identity compact metadata; verified desktop 1-row /
  mobile 2-col).
- **Cosmetic backlog (D-101, parked → chrome polish pass):** the themed scrollbar
  *thumb* doesn't paint in headless captures (overlay-scrollbar rendering); the
  structural fix (header-owns-gutter, track below header) is verified. Revisit the
  thumb-pixel polish at the chrome pass. **Not blocking.**

No open Instrument Detail blockers remain. `MetaStrip`, `PriceChart` amendment,
`.lf-card`/`.lf-card__body`, and the themed-scrollbar/header-outside-scroll patterns
are now platform-wide primitives.

## PAGE-CHROME — C-1..C-6 RESOLVED; Phase 0a BUILT, AWAITING RATIFICATION (2026-07-11)

- **Blockers C-1..C-6 resolved (owner, 2026-07-11)** — recorded in `page-chrome.md`
  §9 + committed. Two changed specs: **D-102** (sidebar responsive: off-canvas below
  laptop, fixed at laptop+; IA §3) and **D-103** (purge-PIN NEVER binds to the unlock
  session — always fresh PIN; SECURITY-BASELINE §3). C-2 Ask-panel deferral confirmed
  (slot reserved, D-067 pending); C-3 version-check endpoints already exist
  (`system/version-check`, `system/update-status`) → verify no-egress + network-trace
  test in Phase 1; C-4 first-run checklist is its own later plan (chrome reserves the
  gate slot only); C-5 session contract reconciles against existing `auth/*` endpoints.
- **Phase 0a — RATIFIED (owner, 2026-07-11) ✅.** Kitchen-sink look passed: icon toggles
  (stateful-glyph rule, DESIGN-SYSTEM §5.5) + LockScreen blur+scrim verified illegible in
  both themes; `☰` reserved, collision-free at narrow width. Commits `acf2d1a`/`77a355e`/
  `f0f4419`. **Phase 1 (shell assembly) is now IN-PROGRESS** (see below). Re-ratify amendments
  that landed: (1) slim TopBar, **icon-only**
  display/rotation/Detail controls, brand narrow-only; (2) StaleBanner/UpdateBanner as
  **full-width status strips BELOW the bar**; (3) Sidebar **progressive reveal** (all six
  D-043 headers, only built pages as entries — Holdings today; `NavItem.built`; `showAll`);
  (4) **bolder active rail** (`--nav-rail-width`). **Icon re-ratify:** (a) **stateful-glyph
  rule** (DESIGN-SYSTEM §5.5) — every stateful toggle shows a state-distinct glyph (theme
  ☀/☾/◐, density ≡/≣, contrast ▨/◧/■, motion ≈/—/≋, rotation ↻/⊘, Detail ╱/╪; `☰` reserved
  for the menu toggle); (b) **LockScreen over a blurred snapshot** — `backdrop-filter:
  blur(--lock-blur=24px)` + heavy `--lock-scrim`, `@supports` fallback to near-opaque
  `--lock-scrim-opaque` so content is unreadable on any browser (D-002). Checks + build
  green, **72 frontend tests**. Owner does a quick kitchen-sink look at the icons + lock
  blur (illegibility check is visual/theirs — no headless browser here), then Phase 1.
  Below is the component set (unchanged surface).
- **Phase 0a components** in `frontend/src/components/ui/`:
  **Sidebar** (D-043 six groups from `ui/nav.ts`; D-102 responsive; router-driven
  active + `activePath` preview override), **TopBar** (D-066 layout container;
  relocates DisplayControls; owns rotation D-044 + Detail D-040 toggles; `askSlot`
  reserved for D-067), **StaleBanner**, **UpdateBanner** (presentational; no-egress
  guard is Phase-1 data-layer), **DemoBadge**, **Clock**, **LockScreen** (D-002 access
  lock; min-6 PIN; reuses ConfirmDialog pattern). DESIGN-SYSTEM §5.5 gains the chrome
  inventory table (PROPOSED). Staged at `/kitchen-sink` ("Global chrome (§5.5)");
  ratification checklist in `page-chrome.md` §10. **No shell assembly / router wiring /
  backend change yet** — Phase 1 after ratify. Checks: lint/typecheck/drift + **70
  frontend tests** (8 new) + build all green.

- **Page-chrome Phase 1 (shell) + Phase 2 (tests) — DONE (2026-07-11).** `AppShell`
  (`components/AppShell.tsx`) composes Sidebar + slim TopBar + status strips + lock gate
  once around every route via `AppRoutes` (`AppRoutes.tsx`); kitchen-sink stays outside
  the shell. DisplayControls moved out of Holdings/InstrumentDetail/App into the TopBar
  (D-066). Redirects wired (D-042/D-022/D-056); unbuilt routes → honest `NotBuilt`. Chrome
  data via `api/system` (auth-state→lock, version-check→UpdateBanner) + `api/chrome`
  (settings→Clock/DemoBadge, summary→StaleBanner). **C-3:** backend no-egress guard added
  to `GET /system/version-check` (zero outbound under `privacy_mode`) + network-trace
  acceptance test; summary gained `stale_count`. Commits `93b717c` (Phase 1) + Phase 2
  tests. **Frontend 79 · backend 479 · drift/typecheck/lint/contract green.**

## PAGE-CHROME — DONE ✅ (milestone SIGNED OFF, owner, 2026-07-11)

**The global chrome (app shell) milestone is complete and owner-signed-off.** C-1..C-6
resolved; Phase 0a (7 components ratified) → Phase 1 (shell assembly + C-3 no-egress
guard) → Phase 2 (tests) → Phase 3 (4 live-verify batches, all PROPOSED items ratified).
Full record: **`page-chrome.md` §10 (build), §11 (Phase-3 walk §11-1..§11-21), §12
(retrospective)**. Ratified: lucide icon set (ADR-0003), page-action icon-button pattern
(DESIGN-SYSTEM §5.5), TickerStrip global footer (D-047 amendment — DECISIONS + DESIGN-
SYSTEM §5.2), narrow TopBar overflow popover / time-only Clock / DemoBadge sidebar-footer,
ticker speed 30s. Lock no-leak **owner-verified live (D-002)**. **Playwright breakpoint
overflow suite (ADR-0004)** wired into `npm run check`. `TEMPLATE-page-build.md` amended
from the retrospective (copy-hygiene + app-wide-label rules, Playwright/overflow line,
shell-plan note). Parked: D-101 scrollbar-thumb (R-18), ticker speed setting (R-16),
indices→Markets (R-17). Deferred by prior decision: Ask panel (D-067, C-2), first-run
checklist (D-045, C-4). Commits: backend `93b717c`; frontend `1c77f58`→ close-out.

## FIRST-RUN CHECKLIST — DONE ✅ (milestone owner-closed, 2026-07-11)

**The first-run checklist (D-045, C-4) milestone is complete and owner-closed.** Phase 0
(contract deltas: `timezone` + `first_run_complete` settable via `PUT /settings`) → Phase 0a
(3 §5.5 components ratified: `Switch`, `Combobox`, `FirstRunChecklist`) → Phase 1 (overlay
mounts in `AppShell` after the lock gate; five steps wired to canonical endpoints) → Phase 2
(tests) → Phase-3 pre-pass (scripted smoke caught **F1–F11**, all fixed) → Phase-3 live walk
(batch 1 §11-1 pinned-header/footer layout; batch 2 §11-2 F3 confirm-on-pick + §11-3/F6
provider-429 backoff). Owner live re-verify passed (SGD-as-suggested confirms). Full record:
**`page-first-run-checklist.md` §10–§13** (§13 = retrospective). Replaces PersonaOnboarding
(killed, D-045). Shipped platform patterns: **`CommitMenu`/`onCommit`** commit-on-pick selects
(DESIGN-SYSTEM §5.5), **gate-overlay D-101 layout** (pinned header/footer, desktop no-scroll,
sheet <900px). F6 backoff (Retry-After · cooldown breaker · honest-stale FX) is
provider+worker-only, **contract untouched**. ROADMAP additions this milestone: **R-22..R-25**.
Owner DECLINED for this milestone (recorded §12a): personal-profile fields, display-axis
onboarding steps, per-lane provider config. Checks at close: **95 frontend + 32 Playwright +
487 backend**, contract current.

## NEXT

1. **Portfolio page build (D-023) — via the template loop.** Instantiate
   `docs/plans/page-portfolio.md` from `TEMPLATE-page-build.md`, **PLAN ONLY first** (owner
   reviews the plan before any code). Portfolio is the canonical **overview-template** page
   (Holdings' linked P-1 summary target). Fill every section from the specs; surface any NEEDS
   DECISION before build; the new template Phase-3a (scripted pre-pass green before the owner
   walk) applies.
2. **Help copy task** (for the Help page plan, or a Holdings help section) —
   surface the new GLOSSARY corporate-actions canon as in-app [Help] copy:
   **Rights issue** = Buy at rights price; **Buyback** = Sell at offer price
   (existing types, no special form); **Ticker / name change** supported (name
   edits preserve history); **De-merger / Spin-off** parked (ROADMAP R-7).
3. **Next page builds** — each via `docs/plans/TEMPLATE-page-build.md`, per the
   API-CONTRACT delta table: entity CRUD (D-065), the Realised P/L / Review /
   Ongoing-cost renames (D-026/D-030/D-029), route-rename redirects
   (D-022/D-056). `/refdata` (D-005) + holdings CSV (D-050) already shipped in the
   Holdings build.
4. **Ratify authored DEF-2/DEF-6 vocabularies** (MASTER-DATA §2/§6) — data vocab,
   separate from design tokens.

## Needs decision

All open items are **ratification of authored PROPOSED values** (not blocking):

- **DEF-2 `asset_subclass` (MASTER-DATA §2)** — ratify/amend the 6-value vocab;
  `etf`/`reit` are the two speculative additions (D-009, not in code). Now carry
  **D-085 classification guidance** (class=exposure, subclass=wrapper); still
  PROPOSED pending kitchen-sink ratification.
- **DEF-6 sector seed (MASTER-DATA §6)** — the 11 GICS sectors were **affirmed at
  review (A2)**; ratify formally at kitchen-sink. The 3 no-map values stay
  `sector=null` and now surface as the D-082 "Not sector-classified" bucket.
- ~~Design tokens (DESIGN-SYSTEM §2)~~ — **RATIFIED 2026-07-10** (with 3
  amendments: accent, light gain, treemap magnitude scale). Only residual: a
  **future** ADR if the UI/serif fonts are ever self-hosted (fallback stacks ship
  now). See `docs/plans/RATIFICATION.md`.
- ~~Cash flow route~~ — **resolved**: `/cash-flow` canonical, `/planning`
  redirects (D-022 principle applied to D-056).
- ~~Segment/category chart palette~~ — **RESOLVED (ratified 2026-07-10)**: the
  5-tone slate-ramp+accent palette approved as implemented.
- ~~Generic `Select` primitive~~ — **RESOLVED (ratified 2026-07-10)**: `ui/Select`
  is the home for non-master view-scope selects; MasterSelect stays bound to
  MASTER-DATA vocabularies.
