# CURRENT — Active Plan

**The next session starts from files, not memory.** This file tracks live status: what
is DONE (owner-accepted), what is NEXT (the active milestone), and what comes THEN. The
full acceptance record for every closed page/milestone is the central log in
`RATIFICATION.md §6`; each carries a §-retrospective in its own plan file. Release scope
and gates live in `release-readiness.md` (RD-9); parked items in `ROADMAP.md`.

## DONE — owner-accepted (RATIFICATION §6)

The product shell + every built page + the platform milestones, owner-accepted:

- **Chrome / app shell** · **First-run checklist**
- **Holdings** · **Instrument Detail** · **Portfolio** · **Net worth** · **Pricing
  Health** · **Markets** · **News** · **Review** · **Heatmap** · **Home**
- **Policy** · **Cash flow** · **Scenarios** · **Insurance** · **Estate** ·
  **Accounts** · **Reports** · **Reports Pack** · **Settings**
- **Help (`/help`) + Settings → About** — **closed 2026-07-19**, `page-help.md` §9/§9-bis
  **CLOSED** + §16 strike-check. The Help page rebuilt on a three-section journey after the 0a
  specimen was REJECTED; **the knowledge base rewritten** (the v1-era entries were factually wrong,
  and `app/ai/tools.py:145` feeds them to the AI as grounded fact — AI-surfaces' grounding review
  must read the NEW content); **About moved out of Help** to become the 7th Settings tab, rebuilt on
  the four-beat template. **THE HELP CURRENCY LAW** established (CLAUDE.md hard rule + TEMPLATE §8):
  every close states a Help delta or a guard-corroborated "no Help impact". `RATIFICATION.md §6` row
  appended. **Open:** 18 hardcoded-port smoke specs (`08-TECH-DEBT.md`) — the harness must fail
  closed; queued as its own delta.

- **data-feed-routing (R-38)** — **closed 2026-07-18**, `data-feed-routing.md` §14
  **CLOSED (29 findings / 9 batches)** + §15. The owner walk was **deferred to the
  pre-release walk** by dated ruling (§14 ruling 1c); acceptance basis = the batch-9
  report reviewed in chat + the §26-bis real-posture closing evidence (`62034a7`).
- **intraday-series (R-42)** — **closed 2026-07-18**, `intraday-series.md` walk ledger
  **CLOSED (3 findings / 1 batch)** + §15 strike-check. Owner-accepted on the live 3b
  re-walk; the **§14dr-25 carryover is FULLY ACCEPTED** (clean TSLA 1D/5D on the real
  instance). `RATIFICATION.md §6` row appended.
- **historical-backfill (R-43)** — **closed 2026-07-19**, `r43-historical-backfill.md`
  walk ledger **CLOSED (8 numbered findings, F-1..F-4 + F-6..F-9 — no F-5 was ever
  assigned; 14 defects counting the lettered sub-findings)** + §23 strike-check.
  **The milestone that made the Net-worth trend REAL** — a real multi-year series
  (2019→today) at **6/6 coverage ending at the live headline**, owner-accepted in chat on
  his own instance. Includes **R-8** (historical per-date FX). `RATIFICATION.md §6` row
  appended. **Open, ruling owed:** §21-3 (a `TimeoutError` escaping the AMFI chunk loop);
  **R-50** filed POST-RELEASE.

## NEXT — Legal

**The v2.0.0 legal surface** (RD-9 Amendment 4, item 2 — Help is closed above).

**PLAN ONLY first — verify-first, STOP at §9** (the R-35/R-38/R-42/R-43/Help plan-file-first
precedent). No code before the owner's §9 one-pass.

**Carried in from the Help close, and binding on this milestone:**

- **THE HELP CURRENCY LAW applies from the first commit.** Legal ships user-facing surfaces and
  terminology, so it has a **Help impact by default**; "no Help impact" is the exception and carries
  the burden of proof. The **HELP CURRENCY SUITE** (TEMPLATE §8) runs at the close.
- **`docs/audit/ASSETS.md` is the register for vendored redistributed assets**, and the author
  photograph's licence line is settled there — *© Gopala Subramanium, all rights reserved; …  not
  covered by the AGPL licence of the code.* Legal must reconcile with it rather than restate it:
  `LICENSES.md` and `NOTICE` are **generated** and would erase a hand-edit.
- **DS §3 standing rule** — prose in content surfaces is **full-width responsive by default**; a
  fixed reading measure only where explicitly ratified, per surface. A legal surface is prose
  end-to-end, so this is the rule most likely to be tripped.

## THEN — the road to v2.0.0 (RD-9 Amendment 4 + 5 + 6)

The remaining v2.0.0 set, in sequence (**Help** is the active NEXT above):

1. ~~**Help**~~ — **CLOSED 2026-07-19** (DONE above).
2. ~~**Legal**~~ — the active NEXT above.
3. **AI-surfaces** — D-067 / D-068. **⚠ INTAKE CROSS-NOTE (added 2026-07-19, page-help §9-9 ruling —
   READ BEFORE THE GROUNDING REVIEW):** the **help knowledge base was REWRITTEN in the Help
   milestone**. `app/services/help.py` is not just the Help page's content — `app/ai/tools.py:145`
   pulls it into the **grounded fact pack**, so it is what the AI cites as fact. The v1-era entries
   it used to serve were **factually wrong** (they described "Snapshot", "Planning", "Investment
   policy", a removed Simple/Expert toggle, four Settings tabs where six ship, and wording D-021 /
   D-026 had retired). **AI-surfaces' grounding review must read the NEW content — never the
   pre-Help entries**, and must not treat any pre-2026-07-19 review of AI help-grounding as still
   valid. Accuracy is now mechanised by `tests/unit/test_help_content_accuracy.py`. **Intake (added
   2026-07-19, R-43 §18-F7d):**
   `test_performance_question_pulls_risk_metrics` streams `/ai/chat` and asserts the risk
   facts arrive; it is **contention-fragile** — it fails only when the suite shares the
   machine with other pytest processes, and passes solo (controlled comparison in
   `r43-historical-backfill.md` §18-F7d). The robustness fix belongs to this milestone as
   the natural owner of the AI streaming surface, NOT to R-43.
4. **R-45** — per-instrument + default news coverage (pulled into v2.0.0, RD-9
   Amendment 5; egress ruling required, take together with R-44). **Verification item
   (observed 2026-07-18):** the **Home holdings-scoped headlines vs per-ticker feed
   inconsistency** — confirm/resolve in the R-45 walk (also noted in ROADMAP.md's R-45 row).
5. **R-46** — Home summary cards (pulled into v2.0.0, RD-9 Amendment 5; sequencing
   suggestion: adjacent to R-39).
6. **chrome-sidebar-refresh (R-39)** — the **FINAL pre-release** milestone.
7. **Pre-release owner walk** — `docs/plans/pre-release-walk.md` (the thorough capstone;
   carries the deferred verifications — dr-25 chart sign-off **[DONE at the R-42 close]**,
   dr-28 owner-eyes; plus the R-42-appended mixed-currency / intraday / fund-P/L checks
   and the **R-43-appended 10d–10g** — mixed-provider backfill spot-check, 6/6 trend with
   the carried note, **§20-P `LEDGERFRAME_SECRET_KEY` as a Gate-C blocker**, TWR/1Y once
   coverage fills).
8. **Gates C→F clear** (`release-readiness.md`) → **tag v2.0.0.**

**R-41 / R-43 / R-44 — RESOLVED (RD-9 Amendment 6, owner 2026-07-18):** R-43 **IN** (with
R-8); **R-41** (per-provider credentials — YAGNI) and **R-44** (news thumbnails —
cosmetic, rides the R-45 egress ruling) are **POST-RELEASE**.

**Post-release:** **R-41** · **R-44** (above) · **Voice (R-32)** — post-release, definition
owed · **R-40** (Alpha Vantage premium feed expansion) — parked, definition owed.

## Needs decision

- (none open). **RESOLVED 2026-07-19 — the author photograph's licence terms**
   (page-help §9-bis-14, `docs/audit/ASSETS.md`). The owner ruled:
   *"© Gopala Subramanium, all rights reserved; included in this repository by the
   author; not covered by the AGPL licence of the code."* The photograph is
   **carved out of the AGPL grant covering the code** — downstream recipients get
   the AGPL rights to the source and **no right to redistribute or modify the
   author's likeness**. The full line and its consequences live in
   `docs/audit/ASSETS.md`, which is its only home: `LICENSES.md` and `NOTICE` are
   regenerated wholesale and would erase a hand-edit.
