"""Dependency-licence audit over the FULL TRANSITIVE graph — backend + frontend.

release-readiness Gate **A8** (RD-2). Committed to the repo so it is **repeatable**, not a one-off:
E4 re-runs it against the final public set, and **no public claim ships before it runs clean**.

What it does NOT do: **adjudicate.** It reports what it finds and flags anything copyleft-ish or
unknown. Whether a given licence is compatible with shipping AGPL-3.0-or-later — and with the D-001
"future proprietary layer" — is **owner/counsel territory**, not a script's.

Two scopes, deliberately separate, because they carry different risk:

* **RUNTIME** — what a user actually receives and runs. This is what a distribution claim is about.
* **DEV** — build/test tooling. It does not ship, but it is reported anyway so the owner can see it.

**"Clean" means ZERO UNADJUDICATED FINDINGS — never "zero findings".** The dependency graph will always
contain licences that need a decision; the release gate is that every one of them **has a recorded
ruling** in ``scripts/license-adjudications.toml``. Adjudication is an **artifact, not a conversation**.

**Stale rulings are findings too.** A ruling whose package has vanished, or whose licence no longer
matches what the package actually ships, fails the audit — a rubber stamp that outlives the thing it
stamped is worse than no stamp, because it looks like diligence.

Exit codes: ``0`` clean (every finding adjudicated) · ``1`` something needs a human.
