# D-070's ruled, user-visible fallback signal — normative in `SECURITY-BASELINE.md` §5 and
# `DECISIONS.md` D-070, and until now it existed NOWHERE in the codebase (AI-surfaces §0-G:
# grep across app/, frontend/src/ and tests/ returned zero hits). The validator correctly
# discarded unsafe model text and emitted the deterministic template — silently. The reason
# travelled only as `done` event metadata, which no frontend read because no frontend existed.
#
# It is SERVED, not composed client-side: a legal-adjacent string assembled in the browser
# would be a second source of truth for the sentence, which is the §0-C mistake repeated in
# the milestone that fixes it.
