# SECOND TIER — annotations on facts that carry NO `figure_id`: a per-holding or per-class WEIGHT, a
# quote's or a series' CHANGE. The F-7 survey found five of them rendered by ambient inline f-strings
# (`{…:.1f}%`, `{…:+.2f}%`) that drifted from the canonical pages on TWO axes — precision (1dp vs the
# pages' 2dp: the two-faces defect W-2 caught live) and vocabulary (`Allocation (asset_class) — equity`
# leaking an internal token + a raw enum). The ruling KEEPS them (useful grounding context) but
# DECLARES them: each renders ONLY through a money.py variant, enumerated here, and a census guard
# (`test_no_ambient_pct_fstring_survives_in_the_pack`) proves no ambient annotation f-string survives.

# --- FIGURE IDENTITY (AI-surfaces §14-3 / Finding 5, owner-ruled 2026-07-20) -------------------- #
#
# The pack is merged from sources that OVERLAP, and `_dedupe` used to deduplicate by LABEL — so
# two labels for one figure were, to it, two facts. The 0a walk found the result on screen:
#
#     Total unrealised P/L   79,326.30 SGD
#     Unrealised P/L         79326.3 SGD
#
# One figure, twice, one copy raw — on the one list in the product whose job is to let a reader
# check the answer against its basis.
#
# ⚠ IDENTITY IS DECLARED, NEVER INFERRED FROM THE VALUE. The cheap version of this fix — "drop a
# fact whose rendered number already appears" — is a DATA-LOSS BUG waiting for the first user with
# no liabilities: **Net worth** and **Total assets** are then equal, and they are two different
# figures that merely coincide. Collapsing them would delete a fact the reader asked for. A
# coincidence of values is not an identity, so identity is written down here where it can be read
# and argued with.
#
# ⚠ THE CANONICAL LABEL AND THE CANONICAL VALUE CAME FROM DIFFERENT SIDES, which is why this is a
# map and not a choice of winning source. GLOSSARY.md:157/161 make **Unrealised P/L** and
# **Total return** the canonical SPELLINGS — the `performance_facts` side — while the canonical
# VALUES come from `value_portfolio`, the canonical reader, via `portfolio_facts`. Neither source
# was wholly right. So the survivor keeps the winner's value and is RELABELLED to the canonical
# spelling.
#
# ⊕ R-54 Phase 0-2a — ABSORBED. This table WAS `FIGURE_IDENTITY`, a 9-entry map living beside an
# unrelated `term_id` map in `analytics.py`, with no endpoint on either. §9-B ruled ONE registry:
# figure identity → canonical GLOSSARY label → canonical endpoint. It now lives in
# `app/services/figure_registry.py` (services, not ai — `analytics.py` derives from it at 0-2b and
# a portfolio surface must not import the AI package to learn its own figures' names).

# the page rendered the whole entry, the model got its opening paragraph. Asked *"why do I have to
# accept terms"* the AI was handed the Legal document's six-article STRUCTURE while the ruled
# answer — declining is a real answer, a changed document re-asks, a reset clears acceptance — sat
# one field away in `interpret`, unread.

# so every glossary term projected `body` ALONE — the very failure this widening was ruled to fix,
# landing on the one category tier-1(a) ("what is XIRR") is built from. The ruling was right and

    what is done with it, so a regression here is a routing regression and never an assembly one.
