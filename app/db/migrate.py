"""Bring the database schema up to date — safe for create_all-bootstrapped DBs.

LedgerFrame bootstraps fresh databases with ``Base.metadata.create_all()`` at
startup, so an existing database often already has the current schema but **no
Alembic version stamp**. A plain ``alembic upgrade head`` then tries to re-run the
initial migration and fails with "table accounts already exists".

``run_migrations`` resolves this deterministically by checking whether the DB is
*actually stamped* (an ``alembic_version`` row), not merely whether the table
exists — a previously-failed upgrade can leave an **empty** ``alembic_version``
table, which still needs adopting:

  • no app tables                    → ``upgrade head`` (create everything)
  • app tables but no version row     → ``stamp`` the initial revision, then
                                        ``upgrade head`` (idempotent migrations
                                        apply only what's missing)
  • already stamped                   → ``upgrade head`` (normal path)

As a final safety net, if ``upgrade head`` still raises against an existing
schema, we force-stamp ``head`` (the running code's create_all guarantees the
current schema is present) so the update never fails and future upgrades are clean.
