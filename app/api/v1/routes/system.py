    correctly-behaving install **every key in the file is also an OS environment variable**. A

    or the isolated pre-pass harness.

    A key present in the environment and ABSENT from the file counts, for the same reason: an
    EnvironmentFile only sets keys the file contains, so that value came from somewhere else — and
    that somewhere else reasserts on every restart.

    ⚠ KNOWN LIMIT, recorded rather than papered over: `apply_env` writes the file AND `os.environ`
    together, so immediately after a save the two agree and this reads False — correctly, for the
    running process. If the override came from a systemd ``Environment=``, it reasserts at the next

# §14dr-26 — tables "Erase all data" PRESERVES. Everything else in Base.metadata is
# user data and is purged; a NEW table is purged by default (the safe direction — the
# owner's erase-and-rebuild walk found insurance/estate rows surviving because the old
# hardcoded delete list predated those milestones). Each exclusion is spec-grounded:
#   settings/PIN/access — D-103 docstring "Keeps your settings, PIN"; users holds the
#     PIN hash; api_token/revoked_token are the access-credential + session-revocation
#     bookkeeping (SECURITY-BASELINE §1.7/§2.4), not portfolio data.
#   security/backup bookkeeping — audit_events is the tamper-evident hash-chained log
#     (the erase itself is a recorded action; wiping it would destroy that record);
#     backup_records is backup metadata.
#   provider reference caches — amfi_schemes/coingecko_coins/ecb_fx_rates/kite_instruments
#     are opt-in, re-syncable public master/reference data (their model docstrings), not
#     the user's holdings; routing_matrix is the user's provider-routing preference,
#     which D-103 preserves as "provider config".
# (alembic_version is preserved automatically — it is not a mapped model, so it never
# appears in the Base.metadata purge walk.)
#
# LEGAL CONSENT IS *NOT* KEPT, AND THAT ABSENCE IS RULED, NOT OVERLOOKED (page-legal §11-D3,
# architect under delegation, 2026-07-20). `legal_acceptance_events` is named here precisely
# because §14dr-26's premise is that every table's fate is triaged — "absent from the keep list"
# and "nobody thought about it" are indistinguishable by inspection, and this comment is the
# difference.
#
# It was briefly KEPT, on a defensible argument: acceptance is install-level, it sits in the same
# family as the PIN this list preserves, and "clear my holdings" is not obviously a request to
# withdraw consent. The ruling INVERTED that. The gate binds the PERSON using the install, not the
# machine; a reset returns the install to first-run posture, and the commonest reason to press it
# is to hand the install to somebody else. A surviving acceptance would then be the PREVIOUS
# user's, and the app would treat a new person as having read and accepted a document they have
# never seen — a FALSE RECORD OF CONSENT, which is the one thing this table must never hold.
#
# The two failure modes are not symmetric, which is what decided it: keeping the record fails by
# attributing an agreement to someone who never gave it; erasing it fails by asking a returning
# user to press Accept again. Only one of those is a lie.
#
# THE ERASURE IS STATED IN THE CONFIRMATION COPY (Settings.tsx `ResetDataControl`), and that is a
# CONDITION of the ruling rather than a courtesy — an unannounced erase is a silent re-lock, which
# is what the preceding decision refused. Pinned from both ends:
#   * `test_a_data_reset_ERASES_acceptance_and_the_gate_RE_FIRES` (test_legal_acceptance.py)
#   * `test_the_reset_confirmation_copy_STATES_the_erasure`       (test_reset_data.py)
# ⚑ REVERSIBLE — a delegated ruling, carried to the owner at the re-look.
