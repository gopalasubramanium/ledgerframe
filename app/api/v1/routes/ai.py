# ── RATIFIED POSTURE COPY (§9 (f): "strings stay PROPOSED until 0a"; ratified 2026-07-20) ──
#
# The one sentence on the Ask panel that states what the DEVICE is doing. It is served, never
# composed client-side, for the reason §0-C exists: a posture sentence assembled in the browser is
# a second source of truth for a claim the product makes about itself.
#
# Named constants rather than inline literals so the ratified wording can be PINNED
# (`tests/unit/test_posture_copy_ratified.py`, the AC-L3 spec<->code parity pattern). Inline
# literals in a route body cannot be bound to a record without grepping a function, and a string
# nobody can bind is a string that drifts.
#
# ⚠ NO_EGRESS carries a divergence found at the 0a walk — see ai-surfaces.md §12-3. The drafted
# copy said no-egress meant no AI at all; what SHIPPED says answers are still built, from the
# user's data, without narration. The shipped sentence is the true one, and R-54 (tier-1
# deterministic answering) owns the amendment when that capability formally lands.
# ⊕ R-54 POSTURE-COPY AMENDMENT (Phase 1 delta 1; owner item-6 direction 2026-07-21). Recut per
# §9-G: "Hailo" leaves served copy; ONE user-facing local descriptor ("Ollama-compatible"); one
# locality phrasing; POSTURE_DISABLED's "fact-only" re-cut now tier-1 explains terms, not only
# figures. The strings are PROPOSED — formal ratification is by LOOKING at 0a-ii, rendered live —
# but the AC-L3 parity guard binds code↔record throughout, so the recut wording is recorded in
# `ai-surfaces.md` §12-3 with a dated note ("both versions true in their time").
#
# ⚠ NO_EGRESS keeps "answers are built" (pinned by
# `test_the_no_egress_string_is_the_one_the_owner_RULED`, §12-3): it GAINS the tier-1 clause —
# answers are now built from your data AND the app's own explanations, not "from your data only".
# ⊕ W-7(ii) (owner 2026-07-22, 0a-ii loop-1): "no AI narration" → "no MODEL narration" — the two
# other narration surfaces already say "model" ("no model was used", "…External model…"), and AI is
# the whole surface, not the thing this line withholds. The pin was updated deliberately with a dated
# §12-3 note; ratified by looking at 0a-ii loop-2.

    No secrets — only the base URL's host is considered, never the key (§8).

    ⊕ 2026-07-20 (§14-3, Finding 6). The posture branch that used to live inline here is now
    `app.ai.vocabulary.resolve_posture()`, shared with `/system/ai-config`. It was duplicated
    logic reading two different sources — this route read `get_settings()`, the Settings tab read
    the `.env` FILE — and they disagreed the moment OS env was set. **Two surfaces working the
    same fact out separately IS the defect**; one resolver is the fix, not a tidy-up.

    NO-EGRESS FIRST, and it OVERRIDES the configured provider (R-22 AMENDMENT, owner 2026-07-20,
    option (b)) — that ordering now lives in the resolver, with its reasoning.

    The posture is still SERVED rather than inferred from `health.available`. An unavailable
    provider and a switched-off one look identical from the client, and they are the opposite of
    each other: one is broken, one is the product doing exactly what it promised. That is the
    distinction Commitment 3 turns on, and the same one the typed EgressBlocked re-raise preserves
    inside the providers.
