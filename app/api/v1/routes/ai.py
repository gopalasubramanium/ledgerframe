# The one sentence on the Ask panel that states what the DEVICE is doing. It is served, never
# composed client-side, for the reason §0-C exists: a posture sentence assembled in the browser is
# a second source of truth for a claim the product makes about itself.
#
# Named constants rather than inline literals so the ratified wording can be PINNED
# (`tests/unit/test_posture_copy_ratified.py`, the AC-L3 spec<->code parity pattern). Inline
# literals in a route body cannot be bound to a record without grepping a function, and a string
# nobody can bind is a string that drifts.
#
# ⚠ NO_EGRESS carries a divergence found at the 0a walk — see ai-surfaces.md §12-3. The drafted
# copy said no-egress meant no AI at all; what SHIPPED says answers are still built, from the
# user's data, without narration. The shipped sentence is the true one, and R-54 (tier-1
# deterministic answering) owns the amendment when that capability formally lands.

    No secrets — only the base URL's host is considered, never the key (§8).

    ⊕ 2026-07-20 (§14-3, Finding 6). The posture branch that used to live inline here is now
    `app.ai.vocabulary.resolve_posture()`, shared with `/system/ai-config`. It was duplicated
    logic reading two different sources — this route read `get_settings()`, the Settings tab read
    the `.env` FILE — and they disagreed the moment OS env was set. **Two surfaces working the
    same fact out separately IS the defect**; one resolver is the fix, not a tidy-up.

    NO-EGRESS FIRST, and it OVERRIDES the configured provider (R-22 AMENDMENT, owner 2026-07-20,
    option (b)) — that ordering now lives in the resolver, with its reasoning.

    The posture is still SERVED rather than inferred from `health.available`. An unavailable
    provider and a switched-off one look identical from the client, and they are the opposite of
    each other: one is broken, one is the product doing exactly what it promised. That is the
    distinction Commitment 3 turns on, and the same one the typed EgressBlocked re-raise preserves
    inside the providers.
