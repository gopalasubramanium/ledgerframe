"""Best-effort service control via the scoped root helper.

Used after in-process config changes (data source, base currency) to make the
**worker** process pick up the new environment. Restarting only the worker is
safe from inside an API request — restarting the API itself would drop the very
response we're trying to return (that's what the user-facing "Restart services"
button does, and why it runs detached).
