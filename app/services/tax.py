"""Realised-gains & tax-lot reporting (Phase 2b).

A **separate, read-only** FIFO replay that emits lot-level detail — acquisition date,
per-sell realised events, and open lots — WITHOUT touching ``compute_fifo`` (nothing
that computes valuations changes). Strictly an organisation / reporting aid:

  • **Not tax advice.** Short vs long term is a neutral holding-period split against a
    threshold the user sets; the report never asserts a tax treatment.
  • Realised gains are in each instrument's **native currency** (exact). A base-currency
    total is offered only at **current** FX, clearly caveated (past trades happened at
    past FX, which we do not reconstruct).

    transaction terminates A's lots in the engine (no realised event — a reorganisation, not a sale).

    This is the cross-instrument coordination: rather than teach the per-instrument FIFO
    engines to move lots between instruments, we resolve mergers ONCE here into ordinary
    synthetic buys on B (dated at the original acquisition, so B's normal FIFO consumes the
    oldest carried lot first). Both engines then replay the SAME resolved streams, so they
