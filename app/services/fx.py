"""Currency conversion with a short-lived in-process FX cache.

Rates come from the configured market provider. Conversions are pure Decimal.
A same-currency conversion is always exact (rate 1) and never hits the provider.

Cross rates (e.g. INR -> SGD) are **triangulated through USD** rather than asked
for directly: providers quote the major USD pairs reliably, but exotic direct
crosses are often stale or simply wrong (Alpha Vantage's INR/SGD was ~13% off,
which threw off the value of every foreign holding). USD/INR x USD/SGD gives the
correct, internally-consistent cross.
