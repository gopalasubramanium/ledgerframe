"""The Legal page's served copy (§ legal).

WHY THIS IS SERVED AND NOT A FRONTEND CONSTANT (page-legal §9-3, owner, 2026-07-19).
Legal is static, never personalised, and needs no database — client constants were a defensible
and cheaper option, and the Settings→About licence line is client-rendered today. **The deciding
question was the guard bar, not the transport.** Accuracy guards bind SERVER-SIDE corpora
(`tests/unit/test_help_content_accuracy.py`), so served copy inherits the same truth bar as Help;
a frontend constant inherits nothing. It also puts the Pack footer string on the same side of the
wire as the Pack, which composes server-side — one source, two renderers, no second code path.

WHAT THIS PAGE OWNS, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT (page-legal §9-2 / D-106).
Disclaimers are TWO KINDS of thing and the distinction is load-bearing:

* a **scoped caveat** is served by the reader that owns a figure, sits at the point of use, and is
  **part of the figure** (`tax.py`: *"Open lots by FIFO. Organisation only — not tax advice."*).
  There are ten of them, exports carry them into the file, and **Legal does not own, absorb,
  shorten or centralise any of them**;
* the **product-level position** — no advice, no execution, reporting only — is stated **once**,
  here.

The one-canonical-home rule applies to the second and NOT to the first. **Removing a scoped caveat
is an honesty regression, not a de-duplication** (guarded: AC-L6).

THE NEVER LIST (page-legal §9-8, owner) — binding constraints on every string below, guarded by
AC-L5. This copy never (a) claims compliance with any named jurisdiction's regulation, statute or
tax code — the product has no jurisdiction logic at all, so any such claim is a fabrication;
(b) offers indemnity, warranty or limitation-of-liability terms **beyond what the AGPL already
states** — restating its sections 15/16 in the product's own words risks CONTRADICTING the licence
it ships under, so this page names them and stops; (c) calls itself "secure", "compliant" or
"audited" in the abstract; (d) implies review by counsel.

⚠ EVERY PROSE STRING BELOW IS **PROPOSED**, not ratified. §9-8 bars this CLI from drafting legal
text; what is here is composed from **already-ratified primitives** (the Guarantees, the Help
orientation entries, the per-reader disclaimers, D-060's "for your accountant"). The owner
ratifies each string by looking, at the 0a.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE SEVEN PRODUCT GUARANTEES — VERBATIM.
#
# Ratified source: `docs/specs/PRODUCT-SPEC.md` §3 (lines 62-77), itself verbatim from DECISIONS.md,
# and already destined for this page by name: *"Destined verbatim for the glossary guarantee block,
# THE LEGAL PAGE, and README"* (PRODUCT-SPEC.md:60).
#
# VERBATIM IS ENFORCED, NOT INTENDED: `tests/unit/test_legal_content.py` parses the spec and asserts
# STRING EQUALITY against this tuple (AC-L3). Editing either side alone goes RED. Do not "improve"
# the wording here — amend PRODUCT-SPEC.md and let the guard carry the change across.
#
# Whitespace is the spec's, re-wrapped to single spaces: the source is hard-wrapped at 76 columns
# inside a blockquote, which is a rendering of the sentence, not the sentence. The guard normalises
# both sides identically, so "verbatim" means the same words in the same order — not the same line
# breaks.
#
# ⚠ TWO ARTEFACTS OF VERBATIM-NESS, FLAGGED FOR THE OWNER AT THE 0a rather than silently edited
# (editing them here would be this CLI overriding a ruling):
#   1. Guarantee 7 ends "the contract (below, §8) may not be loosened" — "below, §8" is a
#      PRODUCT-SPEC-internal cross-reference that points at nothing on the Legal page.
#   2. Guarantee 4 contains `long_term_days` in backticks. The served markup subset has no
#      code-span construct, so the backticks render LITERALLY.
# Both are consequences of the verbatim ruling meeting a new surface. The owner decides at the 0a
# whether to amend PRODUCT-SPEC.md (which the guard would then carry here automatically) or to
# accept them as they read.
