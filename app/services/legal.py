"""The Legal page's served copy (§ legal).

WHY THIS IS SERVED AND NOT A FRONTEND CONSTANT (page-legal §9-3, owner, 2026-07-19).
Legal is static, never personalised, and needs no database — client constants were a defensible
and cheaper option, and the Settings→About licence line is client-rendered today. **The deciding
question was the guard bar, not the transport.** Accuracy guards bind SERVER-SIDE corpora
(`tests/unit/test_help_content_accuracy.py`), so served copy inherits the same truth bar as Help;
a frontend constant inherits nothing. It also puts the Pack footer string on the same side of the
wire as the Pack, which composes server-side — one source, two renderers, no second code path.

WHAT THIS PAGE OWNS, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT (page-legal §9-2 / D-106).
Disclaimers are TWO KINDS of thing and the distinction is load-bearing:

* a **scoped caveat** is served by the reader that owns a figure, sits at the point of use, and is
  **part of the figure** (`tax.py`: *"Open lots by FIFO. Organisation only — not tax advice."*).
  There are ten of them, exports carry them into the file, and **Legal does not own, absorb,
  shorten or centralise any of them**;
* the **product-level position** — no advice, no execution, reporting only — is stated **once**,
  here.

The one-canonical-home rule applies to the second and NOT to the first. **Removing a scoped caveat
is an honesty regression, not a de-duplication** (guarded: AC-L6).

THE NEVER LIST (page-legal §9-8, owner) — binding constraints on every string below, guarded by
AC-L5. This copy never (a) claims compliance with any named jurisdiction's regulation, statute or
tax code — the product has no jurisdiction logic at all, so any such claim is a fabrication;
(b) offers indemnity, warranty or limitation-of-liability terms **beyond what the AGPL already
states** — restating its sections 15/16 in the product's own words risks CONTRADICTING the licence
it ships under, so this page names them and stops; (c) calls itself "secure", "compliant" or
"audited" in the abstract; (d) implies review by counsel.

✅ RATIFIED 2026-07-20 (owner, in chat, at the re-look — page-legal §11). Every prose string below
was PROPOSED under §9-8, which bars this CLI from drafting legal text; what is here is composed
from **already-ratified primitives** (the Commitments, the Help orientation entries, the per-reader
disclaimers, D-060's "for your accountant"). The owner ratified them **by looking** — the page in
both themes, and the gate's two sentences named explicitly.

That they are ratified does NOT make them editable at will: an edit here changes the served
document, moves its hash, and re-locks every install (see the hash note below). Legal copy changes
by ruling, as it did here.

# THE SEVEN PRODUCT COMMITMENTS — VERBATIM.
#
# RENAMED 2026-07-20 (owner, page-legal §11-1) from "Product Guarantees": "guarantee" is
# warranty-family vocabulary, and the licence section below states NO WARRANTY. These seven are
# self-enforced behavioural commitments, each one tested. The CLAIMS ARE UNCHANGED.
#
# Rendering source of record: `docs/specs/PRODUCT-SPEC.md` §3, which names this page as its
# destination: *"Destined verbatim for the commitments block, THE LEGAL PAGE, and README"*.
# `DECISIONS.md` is the RATIFYING record and is no longer character-identical to §3 — §3 states
# that relationship precisely, and the apparatus §3 dropped is preserved in its annotation table.
#
# VERBATIM IS ENFORCED, NOT INTENDED: `tests/unit/test_legal_content.py` parses the spec and asserts
# STRING EQUALITY against this tuple (AC-L3). Editing either side alone goes RED. Do not "improve"
# the wording here — amend PRODUCT-SPEC.md and let the guard carry the change across.
#
# Whitespace is the spec's, re-wrapped to single spaces: the source is hard-wrapped at 76 columns
# inside a blockquote, which is a rendering of the sentence, not the sentence. The guard normalises
# both sides identically, so "verbatim" means the same words in the same order — not the same line
# breaks.
#
# THE 0a's TWO ARTEFACTS ARE RESOLVED AT THEIR SOURCE (owner, 2026-07-20, page-legal §11-2).
# The 0a shipped with a dangling cross-reference ("the contract (below, §8)") and with
# `long_term_days` rendering its backticks literally, both flagged rather than edited because
# editing them HERE would have been this CLI overriding a ruling. The owner authorized the edit to
# §3 instead. AC-L3 then carried the cleaned text into this tuple automatically — no hand-edit on
# this side, which is the whole argument for that guard existing. The decision-ID exemption in
# `test_legal_accuracy.py` was DELETED with them, and these seven now meet the full served-copy
# bar unexempted.

# THE PRODUCT-LEVEL POSITION — the one thing this page owns that no other surface states.
#
# Composed from ratified primitives, not authored fresh:
#   * "It reports; it does not act."      — help.py `orientation-what`, a ratified voice specimen
#   * the three no-* clauses              — Commitments 1, 2, 3
#   * "a dash and a reason"               — help.py `orientation-how`
#   * "reporting only" / "organisation"   — accounts.py:103 / tax.py:424, the scoped caveats' own
#                                            wording, generalised to the product level
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE FORMAL REGISTER (page-legal §11-4, owner, 2026-07-20).
#
# The owner read the 0a and ruled that this page must READ AS A FORMAL AGREEMENT: numbered clauses
# and sub-clauses, defined-term capitals, bold/italic conventions.
#
# **REGISTER CHANGES DRESS, NEVER CLAIMS.** That is the ruling's own wording and it is the
# constraint that matters: AC-L5 (the NEVER list), AC-L6 (the scoped-caveat registry), AC-L7 (the
# accuracy corpus, markup-stripped) and AC-L8 (the Pack footer) all still bind, unchanged and
# unrelaxed. A document that acquired gravitas and lost a guard would be the exact failure this
# page exists to prevent.
#
# TWO BUILD DECISIONS, BOTH RATIFIED AT THE RE-LOOK (owner, 2026-07-20 — page-legal §11):
#
# 1. **NUMBERING IS STRUCTURAL, NEVER TYPED.** No clause number appears in any string below. The
#    renderer derives "2.1.a" from position — article index, clause index, item index. Typed
#    numbers are how formal documents rot: insert a clause at 2.1 and every later number in every
#    cross-reference is silently wrong, and nothing can detect it because the numbers are prose.
#    Deriving them makes renumbering free and makes a wrong number impossible rather than unlikely.
#
# 2. **DEFINED TERMS NEED NO MARKUP CONSTRUCT.** They are Capitalised in the text itself — the
#    Platform, the Commitments, the Licence — and defined once in the preamble. This was checked
#    against the alternative (a new inline marker in the sanctioned subset) and rejected: the
#    subset stays at five constructs, `validate_markup` needs no new arm, and — decisively — the
#    accuracy guards read `strip_markup` output, so a new inline marker would be one more way for a
#    phrase to be split and a guard to go quietly green on copy it exists to catch.
#
#    **THE SUBSET IS THEREFORE UNCHANGED, AND `MARKUP_DIALECT` IS NOT BUMPED.** The contract change
#    in this delta is the SHAPE of the served content (bodies become clauses), not the dialect.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The preamble is register apparatus, NOT a seventh content: it introduces no claim and states no
# limit, it only fixes what the document's capitalised words refer to. The six contents the IA
# fixes are unchanged and are the six articles below.

# THE POINTERS (page-legal §9-5, owner).
#
# "Pointer" here means: NAMES THE FILE THAT SHIPS WITH THE SOURCE. Never a URL — a local-first
# product cannot link to a hosted licence page, and a URL would be the one thing on this page that
# stops working offline. Legal reproduces none of these files (§9-5): three of the four are
# GENERATED, and `LICENSES.md` says of itself *"This file reports; it does not adjudicate"*.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 9-5-bis AMENDS THE "NEVER A URL" RULE (owner, 2026-07-20, page-legal §11-3) — narrowly.
#
# The shipped file REMAINS CANONICAL. What is now permitted is a CONVENIENCE link to an external
# authoritative text, and the three conditions are the whole of the amendment:
#   * it is MARKED as a convenience, in the served copy, so no reader mistakes it for the source;
#   * it carries rel="noreferrer noopener" (applied by the renderer, guarded in Legal.test.tsx);
#   * it is NEVER LOAD-BEARING — this page must remain complete and true with every link dead.
#
# That last condition is the one with teeth, and it is why `url` is OPTIONAL and separate from
# `file` rather than replacing it. A reader offline, or running with no-egress on, sees the file
# name and the description and loses nothing but a shortcut. Test the amendment by deleting every
# url: the page must still say everything it says now.
#
# NOTE FOR THE RE-LOOK: a convenience link is an EGRESS AFFORDANCE on a local-first product. It
# does not itself make a call — nothing is fetched, prefetched or preconnected, and the anchor is
# inert until the reader clicks it — but clicking it does leave the device. Flagged rather than
# assumed to be fine.

# =============================================================================================
#
# WHAT IS BEING RECORDED. Not "the user clicked a box" but "this person was shown THIS TEXT and
# answered". Those are different facts, and only the second is worth storing: a consent record
# that cannot say what was consented to is not a record, it is a reassurance.
#
# WHY THE HASH IS OVER THE SERVED CONTENT AND NOTHING ELSE. `content_hash()` digests exactly what
# `all_legal()` returns — every clause, every sub-clause, the Commitments, the pointers, the
# preamble. So:
#   * reword one sub-clause and the hash moves, and every install is asked again;
#   * change a code comment, a CSS rule or a test and it does NOT move, because none of that is
#     the document.
# The alternative — hashing a hand-maintained "legal version" constant — was rejected: it is a
# number someone has to remember to bump, and the failure mode is silent and one-directional
# (text changes, version doesn't, users are held to terms they were never shown).
#
# ⚠ A CONSEQUENCE, STATED PLAINLY RATHER THAN DISCOVERED LATER: because the hash covers the whole
# served document, ANY edit to this file's copy — including a typo fix — re-locks every install
# until the user accepts again. That is the honest behaviour for a consent record and it is also
# a real operational cost. RATIFIED as the shipped behaviour (owner, 2026-07-20, re-look item 4 —
# the gate/stale/reset/decline behaviour accepted as built): the alternative (a curated "material
# change" flag) trades that cost for a judgement call about which edits matter, made by whoever is
