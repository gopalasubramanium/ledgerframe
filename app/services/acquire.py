"""R-43 §12 — the Build-history ACQUISITION preflight.

Before the backfill reconstructs the net-worth series (``app.services.backfill.run_backfill``),
the inputs it values from must actually exist on-stack. F-1/F-2/F-3 all traced to the same root:
step-6 acquisition never ran, so ``ecb_fx_history`` was empty and ``price_history`` was
sparse/wrong-instrument — and the orchestrator valued a garbage series anyway. This module is the
preflight that acquires those inputs first.

Step 2 acquires the ECB ``eurofxref-hist`` per-date FX (one keyless fetch = the whole daily
reference history back to 1999), ingested idempotently. Later steps grow this preflight with the
per-instrument price acquisition (crypto via CoinGecko, funds via the AMFI archive, equities via AV
``outputsize=full``) behind the class-aware capability gate.

Honesty (Product Guarantee 5): under no-egress this makes **ZERO** outbound calls and returns a
served refusal — building history requires the exchange-rate download; a garbage-from-nothing
series is never fabricated in its place.
