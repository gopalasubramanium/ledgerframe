"""THE FIGURE REGISTRY — one table: figure identity → canonical label → canonical endpoint.

R-54 §9-B (owner ruling, chat 2026-07-20). *"Centralizing fact identity into a single
parity-guarded backend table prevents drift and ensures robust reverse-indexing for analytics."*

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS
----------------------
Before it, the product had **no** term → endpoint registry at all (r54 §0-E) and two partial,
adjacent maps pointing in opposite directions:

* ``app/ai/tools.py::FIGURE_IDENTITY`` — label → fact identity, 9 entries, no endpoint. Built for
  the F5 fix (*a coincidence of values is not an identity*: Net worth and Gross assets are equal
  for a user with no liabilities and are still two figures).
* ``app/services/analytics.py`` — 18 metrics each carrying an inline ``term_id``, i.e. metric →
  help entry, which is the *reverse* of what tier-1 needs.

This module is the one table both collapse into. ``FIGURE_IDENTITY`` is **absorbed**: its
label→identity lookups are now served from here.

WHY IT LIVES IN ``app/services`` AND NOT ``app/ai``
--------------------------------------------------
``analytics.py`` derives from it at R-54 Phase 0-2b, and analytics is a **portfolio** surface. A
registry under ``app/ai/`` would make a non-AI page import the AI package to know its own figures'
names — a layering inversion, and the sort that is very hard to undo later. Nothing here imports
from ``app/ai``.

**term_id IS ONE-TO-MANY, AND THAT IS NOT A DEFECT.** ``term-xirr-twr`` covers two figures (XIRR
and TWR — the Help entry itself is a two-term heading, which ``test_glossary_parity`` already
declares), ``term-allocation-weight`` covers four asset-class weights, ``term-concentration``
covers two. So the table is keyed by ``figure_id`` — which *is* unique — and the reverse index
``figures_for_term()`` returns a **set**. Tier-1(a) wants exactly that: *"what is XIRR"* should
show the explanation alongside **both** XIRR and TWR.

WHAT A ROW ASSERTS
------------------
``endpoint`` is the ONE canonical source for the figure — the one-derivation law made
machine-readable. Where a second surface also serves the number (``/portfolio/stats`` re-serves
several ``/portfolio/summary`` figures), the registry names the canonical one and the duplicate is
just a duplicate. That is the property ``test_figure_registry`` proves, and it is the whole reason
to write endpoints down rather than leave them in prose.
