"""Voice service entrypoint.

Privacy posture (enforced):
- Disabled unless LEDGERFRAME_VOICE_ENABLED=true.
- Push-to-talk only by default; wake word is opt-in.
- No continuous recording: the loop idles until a push-to-talk trigger arrives.
- STT/TTS run locally (whisper.cpp/Vosk + Piper) — no audio leaves the device.

This module starts the service loop and degrades gracefully when audio
dependencies or devices are absent: it logs the reason and exits 0 so systemd
doesn't crash-loop. Full capture/transcribe wiring is documented in
docs/VOICE_SETUP.md and is intentionally a thin, swappable layer.
